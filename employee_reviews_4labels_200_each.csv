you learn every critical retail function from site merchandising and marketing to instock management and forecasting given amazon fast paced work culture you learn a ton quickly i ve learned more in my almost 2 years at the company than 3 4 years elsewhere this is a great place to be if you value learning and want to optimize for learning in your career the career progression opportunities abound if you perform well competitive name on resume intelligent coworkers fast paced culture where you are consistently challenged flexible work hours the salary is quite low when compared to hours worked amazon s compensation is awarded over time 4 years where compensation comes with a lower base pay stock and signing bonus the average amazon employee lasts 2 years so you may not realize all these benefits stocks don t vest completely until you have completed 4 years with the company 401k match is not earned until 3 years of service sign on bonus isn t earned until you complete 1 full year with the company if you leave or are forced out prior it must be repaid on a pro rated annualized basis relocation bonus and expenses also have to be paid back if you leave within 2 years pro rated amazon espouses frugality and uses these deceptive tactics to lock talent into a contract where employees are promised fake money awarded over a very long period of time during which many employees either quit or are forced out of the company in regard to compensation i would push to come in as an l5 brand manager instead of l4 brand specialist l5s typically come in at an 84k annual salary stock whereas l4s are usually 65k 20k signing bonus stock total compensation between the roles is almost the same with one key difference within 2 years as a brand specialist you have to get a promotion to an l5 to have it make financial sense to continue unless you want to take a 20k pay cut as the signing bonus is only valid for 2 years promotions at amazon can be very challenging so negotiating to an l5 upfront can be beneficial if you want to stay at amazon long term also annual increases are very minimal on average 1 2 per year if that each year as an l4 you almost feel expendable where the 1st 2 years are a test to see if you qualify to stay and the company and move up to a more steady pay grade as an l5 i would use prior work experience and top tier education to push to come in as an l5 one thing i wish i knew prior to joining amazon lack of appreciation one of the primary drivers of attrition within this role there is no positive reinforcement at amazon on the occasional blue moon someone will pat you on the back and congratulate you for a great win it is rare believe me if something goes wrong it can be blown out of proportion and magnified can be demoralizing over time constant stress anxiety the bar at amazon is constantly rising and you have to go above and beyond and constantly push yourself to make a name for yourself leadership and management have to know who you are and the value you bring to the table stack ranking does occur during the annual review process often times based on favoritism and can be political at times the work environment is competitive cut throat darwinian the strong survive weak perish i ve seen people disappear cry at their desk get yelled at and just walk out and leave the company amazon has a culture that embraces conflict and disagreement amongst people it s very much and a love or hate place to work little grey area between love or hate if you embrace conflict amazon may be a great fit high turnover you have very limited time for family social life etc due to work commitments the expectation is that you are available 24 7 though no one will tell you this directly workload varies by team and time of year i would not recommend amazon as a place for someone who has a family looking to start a family or enjoys having a social life even if you are sick there is constant pressure to work from home and get stuff done incompetent management some managers do not know or have no experience managing teams making it difficult to grow develop and feel challenged constantly dealing with ambiguity the company has a very self reliant culture so make sure you are comfortable managing ambiguous situations and can drive results you teach yourself everything at amazon no one will hold your hand and walk you through things there are a lot of type a personalities that when leading projects across leadership you can be told 5 different things from 5 different people across teams gaining alignment across leadership and buying groups is a huge issue and causes inefficiency when leading and executing projects i would think hard about signing for this role or use it as a short term learning opportunity biggest challenge is as an l4 you feel like a workhorse or object and completely expendable churning out work for leadership with almost no credit for it also one important note amazon does not pay for the brand specialist role it is paid for by the vendor through vendor funding about 300k annually so to put simply amazon is making money on this position one of amazon s core tenets is frugality they will not tell you this upfront but people usually find out after joining in conversations with vendors the typically re evaluate whether they need the brand specialist role in annual negotiations which can make you feel completely expendable respect in the workplace is vitally important and unfortunately amazon doesn t have any of it,at risk of leaving
challenging problem space some execs are not complete morons the most annoying part of working at amazon is how people don t matter at all in this company you are a number no one will give a damn about training you growing you advancing you what you do is completely irrelevant you will be passed over by the cronies of your newly hired director or vp mistresses drinking buddies soccer team mates etc reviews and interviews are passive aggressive driven beauty contests for your success it is much more important to be nice with everyone and not rub anyone the wrong way rather than actually getting something done management is all hired from outside almost never promoted from inside the attrition is ridiculous also because of that the pay and the benefits are such that those able to leave amazon as soon as the all cash compensation period is over especially with a stagnant or declining stock those who stick around tend to be those that cannot go anywhere else and it shows in my career i have never seen so many incompetent morons with the title of director or higher spending all their time and energy trying to defend their position rather than get work done in two years i had the team produce 100x more lines of useless planning documents that no one read or cared about than actual code the few great people i have worked with were all in the intermediate to low levels and were all leaving or looking around the technology stacks i have worked on were all put together with tape and wire more than 90 of the resources were spent trying to get the stratified hacks of ten years to keep working rather than creating something new and it was a mission critical system the technical leadership is the division was non existing there may be some pocket of excellence elsewhere in the company but after i have seen the shambles the supposed core business is in i ran for the door at the first opportunity,at risk of leaving
google is a world of its own at every other company there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills at google i could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise in that way google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world there is a general sense of trust in the company you can leave your valuables and laptops lying around and they are safe people joke that it s the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria while walking away at other companies teams are very protective of their own code trying to execute another team s code requires following a 50 step installation process that s out of date and was never complete to begin with google has almost all the code in the same source repository an engineer can look at the code easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process and contribute enhancements bug fixes the other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements they understand that it s better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways google takes care of you all around from food health care generous vacation onsite gym and so on you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life s hassles there are cases where google goes above and beyond tremendously here is an example that floats around internally a googler had worked at amazon before amazon relocated him because of the relocation he had to change his partner s health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication due to same sex partner and relocation the health insurance company refused amazon was so unhelpful that the hr representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it he switched to google the google hr department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all employees a lot of google products have a huge impact with over a billion users working there you can feel that you change the world i was very happy with the compensation there are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest pretty much anyone can get an intern participate in setting coding standards obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals interviewing supporting local schools with tech expertise google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in google is considered the largest functioning anarchy that has its good sides like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight it also has its dark side like a hands off management tends to encourage politics another beauty for engineers are internal tools your development environment is in the cloud you can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds there is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud the search function across the codebase is powerful you ll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your ide is something of another epoch like something from before the industrial revolution the google badge is a wonderful thing to carry it opens doors to a different world the office spaces are beautiful with work rest and play areas the mtv location is like a utopian city on its own everything in it food drinks work spaces swimming pools gym bowling alleys showers and so on are free for employees it is a whole world of its own most companies have a one over one promotion model your boss has to decide to promote you your bosses boss has to sign off on it at google the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it you can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager rumor has it that managers won t hold a grudge if that happens but support it the hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers there can even be unrequested peer reviews in general it creates an environment that discourages bicycling bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard however some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity it s rare but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review there is some concern about stack ranking but i don t understand enough of the background to comment on it there are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere to underscore how google is one of a kind there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at google someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot when after years he went looking for his car it was gone he went to security he found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved another googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent he wrote a guide on how to do that as there are showers and other facilities it is possible to do so and google let it happen after a while of saving rent payment he could afford the down payment on buying his own place all these stories make google a wonderful place to work at an important topic to bring up is work life balance work life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people getting up to speed at google is consuming depending on your work it could take a year to become productive many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at google some colleagues simply love technology and can t think of anything better than working until the am hours on some tech that gets them excited you can tell these people by physically looking at them for them it is a heaven if you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships you are likely going to be challenged if you signed up for one of the big five tech companies you wanted challenge right if i would do something differently it is to take advantage of all time saving things pay for a laundry service pay for a cleaning service i ve had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level my time shouldn t be more worthy than that of another human being if i could do it all over again i d pay for every possible service to save time in the grander scheme of things if you work at google your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store i don t mean that in an arrogant way if you work on a service with a billion users your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry you ve paid the price in education training and effort to be able to do that make use of your power for the great code the view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point in my humble opinion for full disclosure there are some people who coast at google they probably don t have any complains about work life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting many company mishandle projects when the next time comes around they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren t the ones working late nights and weekends google does two things to get better 1 there are honest and public postmortems they are the pride of a lot of true engineers 2 zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company the survey is quite exhaustive every manager from the ceo to the front line manager reports on the result of his her area then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done this annual and systematic process is very refreshing if you don t work in mtv hq you will be given work however if you are passionate and want to advance your career you should relocated to mtv any project that started doing well and,at risk of leaving
facilities and nothing else do not fall prey to free stuff provided this review is for the young engineers from top colleges of india who decide to join microsoft gtsc role as soon as they finish their degrees microsoft hires from campuses they are known as mach hires we are a part of them we got carried away by the brand name and the pay that they offered one of the pro s of being a mach is you will be treated like royalty in gtsc for the initial few months the administration who take care of mach are exellent but once you get pushed to different teams and you come under different administration your life is going to change however there are one two teams which have good administration but the chances of getting into those teams are very rare even if you do get into those teams the fact is this job does not deserve engineers it requires the skillset of a person who can sell solutions to customers they say that gtsc is not a call center but it is run by the authorities like a call center we are from one of the topmost colleges in india and we came in to this role thinking it will be a journey of a lifetime yes it has become an unforgettaale journey for all of us this company is full of politics and biased managers ego filled and lazy engineers on floor and arrogant technical advisors however there might be exceptions but never take this as your first job choose to be a developer in a startup for a lesser pay but never take up this job tech support is a kind of job which requires capability of selling solutions to the customers this job is not for people who come from tech background this job is considered as a golden opportunity for people who come from call center backgrounds who learn a bit of tech stuff and find their way until microsoft this job is not for students who come from campuses who would have worked hard for four years also to mention one of the most important things you can hardly find people with engineering background in this company they just know how to troubleshoot and lack technical knowledge talking about the growth here almost every engineer is sluggish and they will drag you down when you decide to grow fast looking at the opportunity outside gtsc once you get here is almost nil you will be supporting a microsoft product and you will not have any other job opportunity even if you do the pay will be bad and will be unwilling to quit and you will be forced to stay here also the shifts that you will have to work in you will become an unhealthy person with all sorts of health problems you will have to sleep at around 8 am in the morning and get up at 5 pm in the evening and run to the office your whole eating habits will change you will feel very unhealthy also working at night will take a toll on your mental health because you will not be in contact with the world at all as you will be sleeping in the day and working at night the only set of faces whom you ll see is your teammates you will be asked to work over weekends like sunday to saturday or tuesday to saturday which will drift you away from normal life you will start to forget the feel of sunday morning as even if you work from monday to friday shift you wont be able to sleep on saturday night as you will be awake all over night for the whole week and sleep through whole day of sunday to add on to the woes of this job any national holiday is considered as a leave but in order to stay home that day you will need manager approval for it as only a particular number of people can be on leave for a particular day most of the time you will be not be getting it as the old employees are smart enough to block it soon and you will be working even during a national holiday for example you will have to work during diwali christmas or including new year s eve if you notice you can ask hundred people who are currently working and ask them how is the job and everyone gives a good opinion it s because of the fear of the higher authority like their managers do not fall for their words as they will be helplessly hiding the actual truth last but not the least there will be a huge chunk of people coming from a particular company which is basically a call center and we do not wish to disclose the name of that company who are mostly not engineers and do not have any tech knowledge you will feel ashamed to sit alongside people who lack tech knowledge and boss over you also to mention most of the people 99 and their might be very few exceptions have reached microsoft gtsc not by studying the technology but by being nice to higher officials if you are from a reputed college you will not have the mindset of bowing your head without any reason unless if required and you will be indirectly punished by higher authorities for not doing so in terms of year end reviews my advice to all campus hires take this job up only if you want to spoil your health and career if you are from one of the best colleges from india my advice is not to take up this job we all know how difficult it is to crack a entrance exam and find ways to topmost colleges don t commit the mistake of joining a tech support it doesn t matter even if it is microsoft tech support do not fall prey for the facilities they provide and the pay they provide you will be treated like you are from a call center and will be shouted upon by higher authority people like a worker in factory do not consider this review as one person s opinion this is a collective opinion from almost whole of the mach community,at risk of leaving
at amazon a developer is like a clown in circus must be able to perform all kinds of tricks on acceptable level to get the job done same time you will learn a great deal and will understands it end to end for an sde being a part of amazon web services gives you the edge to work on truly high scale projects and buys you a free ticket to many other work places when you decide to leave interestingly enough right now there is an exodus of microsoft people willing to switch over and work for aws amazon is definitely not for everyone and requires a lot of effort to stay sane yes you will be stressed out almost every day either being on call fixing stuff you never seen before the timer is ticking btw or managing unrealistic project deadlines or very often both in parallel however you may look at it from another angle this is how people bond and develop trust when they go through hell together your amazon co workers will be like your good old army friends forever on call can be horrible depending on the team or time of the year but don t create illusions because the industry is shifting the majority of software jobs towards developing and running services amazon will take you ahead on that and you will learn how it s done on the large scale as a matter of fact at microsoft more and more devs carrying a pager too and also staying sleepless yeah a bit to the east in redmond i like the fact that people don t slack around here and majority of managers are occupied with a plenty of real issues and getting paged too there is very little of bureaucracy here know the right thing to do then go and just do it you will feel empowered when you realize that you control such a huge fleet you will find a lot of smart people around you and most of the time they say what they mean after tasting amazon it is hard to go back to the traditional it company where everything is slow and managers are afraid of changes if you prefer true ownership of what you are given you will find amazon a decent company to work for the attrition is very high which is not good for the moral but again those people who are leaving now will call you some day with a job offer agree with other reviews that you should know a lot of stuff before joining amazon because there is no time to learn or take a class on anything it is a sink or swim environment taking this into account i would say that entering amazon is probably better as the second job when you already know quite a few things learned to code well understand how to manage priorities and now it s time to turn your brain on full throttle amazon has the worst choice of medical plans across pretty much all high tech non startup companies in the area and i don t count ms at all here honestly i do not recommend amazon to my friends because it is not a comfortable place to work at there is a lot of pain going on here and i m not enjoying it but for myself i consider it as the growing pain,at risk of leaving
i definitely tell anyone who will listen that it s a terrible company to work for and they should seek employment elsewhere it s very strange to see your feelings corroborated in the words of several strangers but what s been previously documented is exactly my experience during my years at amazon the average amazon employee stays with amazon for 14 months 14 months i have been with the company for less than 5 years and have been there longer than nearly 80 of the employees for a company that prides itself on efficiency a turnover rate like that seems painfully inefficient and painful it is if you re the one left while your co worker exits the work will definitely fall on you and if you manage to hold things together even just barely you ll see that headcount vanish and suddenly you re doing the work of two people let s talk about leave of absences and people who quit never in my professional career have i worked somewhere were so many people either walk out or simply disappear i ve encountered more than one employee who has gone out on a mysterious leave of absence only to never return and severe all social ties with other co workers never to be heard from again we re talking block on linkedin kind of severing i ve read the comments some people have posted and i d like to set the record straight on a few things the pay to quit program is nothing but a pr hoax that option is only offered to fulltime warehouse employees of which there are few it s well documented that the vast majority of warehouse employees are temp workers of the very few people who qualify for the program it s offered during review season which is when raises promotions and stock grants are given anyone with a brain knows that 5 000 to quit your job is a terrible deal it s mostly intended for the poor performers a way for amazon to avoid firing an employee and paying unemployment also many comments reference that if you don t like your job then just quit you know what you re right you can just quit and if you re that unhappy with your job i would argue that you should however i think the larger point here is that this is all a terrible way to run a successful corporation amazon needs its employees just as much as it needs its customers and the fact it doesn t understand that is what hinders its overall success other players in the space offer lots of perks to keep employees happy decent health insurance amazon s is terrible snacks in the office discounted gym memberships amazon does none of these things are employees entitled to it no we re not but when it keeps the company from getting and retaining the best talent the very talent that is necessary to keep the company going and innovating then it s probably a good idea to offer a few things i m not an organizational psychologist but i m confident that there are studies out there that say that happy employees work harder longer hours and stick around for more than 14 months if you re an average person reading this you probably aren t outraged but if you re an amazon executive or shareholder you absolutely should be i wouldn t go so far as to say that amazon is evil but it is certainly a contentious work environment where people will literally step on each other to climb to the next level amazon s level structure has also been documented and are even encouraged to do so if you want a raise you better figure out a way to eliminate the job of someone below you it s not the most sinister and i m definitely not being abused but i think that the culture is such that it s very difficult to be successful and ultimately not worth the rewards because of this amazon will remain a stepping stone for most not a place to settle into a career oh and i completely agree that the review process is absolute garbage if you ever had a bad day and said something to someone that was even slightly snarky it will come up completely out of context on your review i know several people who have had becomes visibly frustrated at times called out on their review i get visibly frustrated when people try to come onto the subway car before letting me out let alone when i m at work and multiple people have given me conflicting deadlines on projects the bottom line is that you should never have an emotion ever of it will be seen as a weakness your manager can complain and gossip to you endlessly about people on your team or on other teams but never do the same it will come up on your review that you re a complainer the pip thing is also completely real and i ve known a few people who have gotten one completely out of nowhere while nothing this terrible has ever happen to me i have seen it happen around me i have known people who have been screamed at by their managers cursed at and even had comments made to them that were blatantly racist while my personal experience hasn t been completely tragic i definitely tell anyone who will listen that it s a terrible company to company to work for and they should seek employment elsewhere,at risk of leaving
i definitely agree that this job isn t for everyone however it is a warehouse job and that does mean physical labor the turnover rate is high because a lot of new hires see early on it isn t for them and that shouldn t reflect negatively on amazon if anything i find it great that they hire in bulk they seem to give everyone a chance which i know a lot of us need it boggles my mind over these negative reviews your employer created the rules follow them or quit it s really that simple benefits rock atmosphere is great you do feel valued despite reading that we are just a badge number in reality the badge numbers are crucial because if your family calls in for an emergency they need to know where you are to connect you as soon as possible they only require 24 hour notice for vacation you can take pto if you feel like leaving break rooms are fantastic and a wide variety of food drinks etc i would definitely encourage everyone to apply you won t know if you like it until you try if you excel at your job you are noticed right away even on the first day breaks could be longer 10 hour shifts are hard on your feet but honestly stretch and get good shoes,at risk of leaving
it was great to be able to work from home they take good care of their customers will be in business for a long time sorry this is so long i left my job of five years to work at home for amazon and was fired while still in training i want to let prospective employees know how very little it takes to get fired though and how you may not even know it s coming during interview and recruitment i was told i would be on a chat team to assist customers with technical issues via instant message this was not true and i was assigned to a frontline phone support team a horrible assignment and definitely not one i would have left my former job for i really doubt it was intentional but it certainly something they should have told me they called me back a few days after the interview and asked if i could start two days later i could not since i had been with my employer for about five years and wanted to give them two weeks of notice that i was leaving only fair since we had a great working relationship and they depended on me for many things we re still friends outside of work the recruiter agreed or said they did anyway and rescheduled me for training so that i could give notice and i thought everything was looking good until training started a little over a week into training a situation with family came up and i needed an hour of personal time i asked for the time and was told how to handle these requests a couple of days later i was contacted by my manager which is pretty funny because didn t know i had one until then and they wanted to talk about my attendance issues surprising since i didn t know i had done something wrong i didn t say this of course about 10 minutes into this call my manager brought in someone from hr as well it was immediately clear to me that this was a well versed routine and that they were trying to pressure me into quitting which i wouldn t with the hr person on the call my manager went on the offensive and immediately asked me why i punched in precisely 20 minutes early every single day a really strange accusation since it s completely untrue i signed in and out exactly when i was supposed to and i still wonder where this question came from did my manager have the wrong person or was it just an attempt to throw me off or provoke me i ll probably never find out we were told in the training that we had a window of approximately sixty seconds to punch in and out which is really not enough time since we had to use an rsa token and pin to sign into their vpn a little device that gives you a code to sign into their network then had to remotely connect to our desktops then finally login into a time keeping site and hit the punch clock button after that you had 4 minutes left to sign into four different communication platforms email group chat instant message and their knowledge bank i can only imagine how many of the other trainees had similar experiences or worse a shame since i was a huge fan of amazon before i went through all this,at risk of leaving
the company does provide benefits instantly you get bonuses perks and more incentives for job well done you can be cross trained in various departments they provide career course training also after one year they will pay for you to go to school you never can speak to a live person from your personal site from hr by phone which is horrible if you have an urgent need everything with them is done via chat or calling some 1800 number and escalating calls for 24 48hrs to get back to you on matters which they never can give direct answers or are never of much help and when they finally do get back to you it s via email feels like when you re dealing with the cable people or some other order service by phone and talking to foreigners when you just want to speak with someone who knows what s going on and will resolve another with being hired you re going in blind sided they don t tell you what department you re working in all the way up to you start work trying to know department and all between live chat and calling the erc they claim to not know your department you ll be in which is a lie they can find out and do know you re giving one shift and than they randomly change it never mind if you changed your life around based on the already assigned schedule they say oh no worries you ll find out when you re there and if a problem they can change it just talk to hr if any problems but they may just have to change your start date unless they can fit you in on that shift however once there they have a very nasty disposition and say well we can change your department at will based on business needs which is crap so trying to find every way to mediate the issue where we can all be happy is not in there interests the company claims to care about their workers but they do not they attitude was basically this is your shift now and department you can t change it until after 90days which is also false because they will try any and everything to avoid you from switching departments when you start you don t find out your position until 4hrs in to the shift what department you will be in but they simply force your hand leaving you with no choice but to quit call out or use your personal time even if it was there error truth be told that s why it s such a high turnover they under pay for what they expect the employees to do and they re nasty the way they work with picking is not productive rather counterproductive just horrible,at risk of leaving
you get to work with incredibly smart people on products that are at a scale and growing at a speed that most other companies aren t able to achieve aws supports an incredible amount of internet infrastructure and businesses across the world the work you can do has real impact it s also fascinating to see the kinds of customers we get and depending on which team you are on you can interact with some big players relatively often it is very easy to contact people across the company almost everyone in my experience was more than happy to set aside an hour to grab coffee to answer questions about their service or their team it s also nice that there are near constant in company conferences and talks about various aspects of the company and the technologies we use certainly a lot of resources to learn about technologies within amazon and a growing community of people trying to educate about design ux mobile information architecture machine learning etc recruiters are bad at matching you with an appropriate team especially if you are a new grad or don t have much experience you have to work very hard and do your research to find a team that actually fits your interests you can switch teams relatively easily now but teams are still pretty silo d so it can be a long process to cast a wide net and find teams that are working on things that really interest you if you aren t vocal about the work you are doing nobody will know what you are working and will assume that you are slow doing a bad job managers seem to be very perceptive about who is growing or has growth potential when talking about candidates and if you don t seem to be making progress after a few years releasing bigger cross team projects that have bigger and bigger impact communicating across the team taking leadership roles on projects etc they will bring it up in performance reviews promotion is a hard process at amazon you don t simply get a promotion by staying on your team or on a project for a long time you have to show that you are working at the next job level to be considered to get promoted and often times that happens in the form of a level up project a project that has more impact more cross team communication and influence more leadership on your part sde i sde ii promotions are relatively common after 1 5 2 years but sde ii sde iii promotions seem to be rare the promotions i ve seen most commonly happen from jumping teams or companies and then showing that you are operating at the next level in the fresh eyes of a new manager minor gripe we re already so privileged being in the software industry but lack of perks compared to other tech companies is a bummer no free snacks or food only small subsidies to transportation and various gym memberships no free amazon prime a lot of people ask about work life balance it totally depends on your team as i imagine is true on most teams at any company i know people at amazon who work really hard coming in at 9 and leaving at 6 or 7 every day and i know people who show up at 10 30 and leave at 5 30 it depends how vocal you are about your preferences in work life balance how productive you actually are during the day and if you are delivering what you need to deliver sometimes you will have projects where you have to get into crunch mode at the end and sometimes you will have a much better balance it waxes and wanes and depends there is no good answer there pay is a bit lower than competitive for the other tech giants and don t expect much in the way of negotiation unless you have secured offers at the big competitors although i ve heard of people trying to heavily negotiate and hearing back from amazon telling them to just take the other offers it s probably best to negotiate stocks and signing bonuses not base salary,at risk of leaving
amazing benefits pay environment tools stock and 0 1 of the people working there are actually cool but don t get it twisted all the free food snacks drinks etc are made to keep you at work longer looking back at my experience there i can clearly see that i was unfortunate to end up in a team that i was in the fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me but having just moved to fb i didn t think of leaving that early internally people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team i figured that s the reason why they hired a complete new team instead of just moving some people around however people at fb are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company they make themselves believe that they are happy but in reality everyone is constantly anxious they just learn to cope and make it feel normal the pressure is high and the workload tremendous because of the amount of silly meetings that you can t say no to you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed some people at fb told me that work consumed every second of their life they just couldn t switch off i knew of other colleages that they come in on a saturday to do some extra work and some dedicate their sunday evening on projects to add to their internal cv you can t really switch off at least not before 9pm so if you re in a relationship have kids don t go there as a single person i felt bad for my colleagues with a family in my situation and i also speak for the rest of the team there was no support no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were it s all very performance driven so you have to build up that amount of work you do cause everything gets tracked they don t care how you do it just do it this explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts you will be compared to peers on your level so it s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review we had a new manager starting a few months after us and hierarchy was the management style having anything to say went against the manager s principles and clearly we weren t liked so were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager because of their opinions be mindful of what you say not everything is appreciated at fb managers are more valued than ic s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good ic so please be careful and try to make your manager your friend trust me it will help you they have amazing trainings on how to manage bias but in all honesty everyone was biased the way they hired people they way they treated people and the way they rated each other during the annual performance cycle you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus up until now fb was the least favorable experience for me i only say worst experience when i talk to friends they saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment i do want to say that 2 genuinely loves working there unfortunately the majority doesn t,at risk of leaving
working microsoft can be out of this world especially main campus there is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience the diversity of people be it cultures age groups backgrounds genders education is amazing even the products that microsoft creates is diverse compare that with google or facebook who only make advertising revenue your experience will vary between teams but one thing that was consistent for me at least is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes though i had the opportunity to work on some popular products the only way i could ever get my work done according to expectations is if i stayed late in the day most of the time was spent in meetings dealing with build processes iterating specs with the team answering literally hundreds of e mails a day helping test team troubleshoot issues unfortunately a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload and in those cases where it does it s almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take since it relies on your entire team to work 100 efficiently i believe work life balance is actually possible here but it s only at the expense of getting a positive review accountability is important but most of the time it felt like i was taking the blame or being punished for someone else s poor performance on the team at the same time you don t want to point fingers because it makes you look equally bad really the only time i was happy was when i was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule or i was on a team with no slackers sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload say if they were more junior people in their role and management would expect you to help them do their job but would not properly account for this in the estimates over time i eventually learned to manage these things better with politics yes people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem but at microsoft the politics are significantly magnified people are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy therein lies the true problem i eventually left microsoft since it felt like most of my time almost 70 was spent politicking and handling processes coupled with a decrease quality in the products the gradual results of their work environment and a lot of other good people leaving the company microsoft seemed to be going downhill though enterprise and azure have really taken off recently i don t think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of windows revenue in the end surface was an unfortunate flop and windows phone bing are sucking money from the company xbox 360 was doing great when i left but now even xbox one is looking like a poor performer which is really concerning for the company as a whole when you combine these things together office and azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though office 365 has showed promise its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of windows desktops so please be careful it s no surprise they had layoffs recently despite most of them being in the nokia division because of the nokia merger still a considerable chunk of few people in redmond even top performers were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in they were forced to leave or re interview for a new positions in the company which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs a similar approach was used in 2009 it was devastating to morale coupled with the layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year really would not recommend anybody apply to microsoft at least until late 2015 the company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self more efficient but it s too soon to tell what that really means some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work life balance while at the same time they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours none of this is encouraging luckily these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance so now is definitely not the time to consider microsoft look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation,at risk of leaving
on site gym canteen on site doctor there s not much else to add really this is probably one of the most morally reprehensible companies i have ever worked for it is clear that not only it is a cult think of goebbels scale propaganda events they appear to want to be relevant to every disaster there is using events as an excuse to pat themselves on the back for answering a few goddamn phone calls i quit in disgust at not only this but the behaviour that i witnessed they promise you a permanent contract however it is not worth the paper it is written on some advice when working for an american company always always have a backup plan i had already worked for a few yank companies so was feeding my resume out even after hire i had something to go onto many don t they will lure you in with a relocation package then illegally send you documents that they want you to sign after relocation and the commencement of the job what is in these documents backdated forms stating that if you sign you will pay them back every penny of relocation if you quit within 12 months essentially you re an indentured slave for that 12 month period i didn t sign others did as they did not know what and why they were signing as they could not understand the papers they were fired later and walked away with nothing apple will hold your contract over your head and basically blackmail you if you don t meet their stats which by the way are rigged they ll threaten you then blackmail you with ending your contract then threaten you some more it s laughable that they seem to think this is appropriate management strategy or conduct they will also illegally deduct things from your wages make sure if you work here you check your paystubs every month also make sure that you re familiar with employment laws in the country you re working for apple seem to think they are above the law they re not and i had to seek legal advice whilst working for them you re also not able to speak freely to anyone they cultivate a very 1984 vibe always look over your shoulder the smallest thing will be taken out of context and repeated to management they encourage people to crawl over the dead bodies of their comrades in order to get ahead think corporate hunger games it s disgusting as for management walking adverts for psychopathy if ever i have seen one all management care about is themselves it s not what you know it s who you know so most management are busy climbing up the back holes of the people above them they ll promise you career growth but the reality is there is none it s more of a sideways shuffle there s no room for thought or creativity they re just looking for automatons drones if you will it s quite disturbing observing the vapid gazes backstabbing and culture of fear that permeates the place think legitimized scientology if you want an idea on how it is to work there and for some weird reason they think it s appropriate to bribe workers with candy candy i work for money not flipping candy there s a tendency to infantilise the worker and sexism lots of misogyny and sexism they just pay lip service to their anti discrimination policy and if you declare a pre existing condition to your manager be prepared to have this work against you in direct contravention of anti discrimination laws not their policy but actual laws it s terrible absolutely terrible think eight minutes allocated in the day to pee terrible so think long and hard about working there before you apply and think am just able to use them and get the experience i need and get out without having my soul crushed before you even sign the contract they bank on their reputation to get young ones in then chew them up and spit the out the incidents of depression and depressive behaviour in the call centres are huge if you value your individuality mental health and humanity look elsewhere for work i do realise that they pay people to flood these sites with glowing reviews so if you ve made it this far then clearly you shouldn t be applying,at risk of leaving
competitive pay especially with stocks surrounded by smart people i ve never run into anyone that was a moron a couple lazy people but nobody that was just dense working on products people use and recognize most everything is home grown so if you have a problem with a tool or interface the code is available to look at and change or you can track down the person responsible for it i ve experienced a mostly relaxed work environment with bouts of craziness due to deadlines and big projects it definitely varies by team manager they give you a transit card and will reimburse up to 160 per month of parking i ve never heard of layoffs happening ever the past couple years have been really booming in terms of new employees joining the company i ve seen two people get managed out of the company for poor performance they were both basically given a certain amount of time to find another job before they were fired both left with another job i like the location was closer to downtown with one team and now am in south lake union there s plenty of places to eat nearby and lots of new construction popping up on call rotation sucks there s no two ways around that both teams i ve been on have had a one week per every two or three months but it still sucks during that week some on call rotations are worse once you have 6 or 7 years under your belt and are about sde iii you can get out of it if you set yourself up as more of an architect that works across many teams within an organization the work can consume you if you let it i haven t had much of a problem with work life balance except around big deadlines and on call but i ve worked with some people that regularly put in 10 12 hour days i m often the last one in and the first to leave but i make sure to get my tasks done and nobody has said anything about it benefits aren t great their 401k match is only 50 up to a total of 2 of your compensation so if you allocate 4 of your paycheck to the 401k you ll max out their matching contribution medical dental and vision come out of your paycheck but it seems cheaper than previous places i ve worked the employee discount is pitiful 10 off anything sold by amazon directly but limited to 100 off per year prime membership isn t even included or discounted for employees none of the other glamorous tech perks are included free food onsite facilities massages whatever the break rooms have water and coffee and include vending machines that you have to pay for high density seating is annoying and people are complaining that they don t meet osha standards for the number of restrooms available for all the people they ve crammed onto every floor the new buildings going up in downtown denny triangle should alleviate some of this at least temporarily the shuttles could run a little more often especially around quitting time it s a 12 minute walk to the bus terminal by the convention center but that shuttle only comes by every 30 minutes or so they recently added another shuttle route that services that stop specifically but the two shuttles aren t staggered so they always end up leaving the campus about the same time defeating its usefulness frugality is a core principle that drives a lot of annoying policies like the lack of cool perks and developer equipment they ve finally acquiesced that developers need two monitors at their desks everybody just salvaged monitors left by interns or leaving employees anyway but now they ll give you one if you ask they may be providing them by default to new employees now but i m not sure from what i can tell the compensation lags behind places like google and facebook although is pretty close to microsoft,at risk of leaving
amazon is a big name and it looks great on your resume i joke that the best part about working for amazon is that it will help you get a better job when you inevitably leave in 2 years ok where do i begin like most amazonians i was very excited to start working here i loved the company as a consumer and wanted to see how cool it was to work here on the inside for the first 6 months or so it was awesome i felt like i was really going to change the world after a few months my manager left this is pretty common since turnover happens all the time i guess i should have been clued in a little bit when on my first day i met with my new team of engineers i was a dev manager and one of them joked that i was his 5th manager in the past 2 years it really is rare to see folks who have been at the company for more than 2 years we were saying good bye to a team mate at least once month but usually it was more like once week or so after a few months the upper level management on our team hired a new manager for me and a few others he was a guy who immediately assumed he was smarter than everyone else including the amazon engineers and architects who had built the foundation systems that most of the entire company uses and micromanaged the team enforcing mandatory work hours per week control of all communication between managers and engineers etc within 6 months over 50 of the team was gone including long tenured employees with 10 years at amzn etc and oh yeah this new guy put people on pips as well but i don t put all of the blame on the new manager that came in i do put the blame on his manager the person who hired him and our hrbp who were well aware of everything going but but did nothing to stop any of this of course team members tried to move teams but he blocked team transfers citing performance issues or anything else that he could make up a few managed to get out though and they were widely congratulated for those of us that left to move on to better jobs read the pros that i wrote about working for amazon where we all got 50 100 raises etc even taking into consideration the massive stock price increase after we left we all had a history of strong performance at amazon and the advice from other folks within amazon was to stick around for a bit because this guy obviously would not last but none of us felt that a year or however long it would be before s driven out of hell poor reviews from this manager would be worth it for our careers sure enough he s not around anymore,at risk of leaving
the pros well they re pros in s m so if you like pain suffering or giving pain suffering this place is for you free coffee i did like having 3 days off in a row which was accomplished via working 10 hour days i liked my coworkers and some of the supervisors but when work was slow the supervisors would ask people if they wanted to leave early and even encouraged people to take time off if they stayed then they d be forced to pressure people or scare them so they will want to leave on their own by week 2 of working there so if you hate it or sense something is wrong you can use that time to look for work elsewhere off the bat you can take a lot of unpaid pto unpaid personal time off and later are earning pto paid time off after being there 90 days you get a discount of 10 purchases when you are an associate and buy from amazon com they have benefits although u may not live to see it if you aren t in their inner circle coz i did notice certain people goofing around or having inappropriate conversations and lollygagging and suffer no repercussions while others are practically going into cardiac arrest running w their heads cut off trying to keep up at a frenzied pace pay is nice if you work both graveyard and weekends but not enough considering the sleep depravation or not even seeing any of your day time friends and family you don t have time to actually make friends during breaks lunch so if you are not into socializing at work or on your own time it s great they sure are they don t even hide the fact that they don t want people to stick around long and grow w the company they embraced the paid to quit model they will sabotage you if they realize you haven t turned into a robot smart enough to do the job dumb enough to not figure their games they might have you work on a station known to have computer issues or broken equipment send no work your way then question you why your productivity is suffering even if you have tried to wave down a supervisor or a problem solver to get help to allow you to stow in bins after having hit the button to alert a problem solver or amnesty associate to no avail even if you indicated on the alert that you can t continue working because of an issue you re allotted 2 15 minute breaks but they start the countdown as soon as it is yelled out to go take one you are prevented from wearing a watch and sometimes the clock is wrong at your station so you do have to use your peripheral vision to see if others are vacating their areas your break area may be 2 min to even 7 minutes away so that is subtracted from the actual break taken hence if you take it at 10 40 and get to the break area at 10 45 then you know in order to get back to station on time you need to leave in 5 minutes to walk back by 10 55 good luck if you stay as hydrated as they post all over the place because then you ll be late coming back or have to eat and drink in a hurry food is not permitted in work area only water they have mandatory overtime during high season or certain holidays,at risk of leaving
if you re looking for a job that requires minimal thinking with a salary that will just get you by for a few months this is the place for you the pay is decent for a company that will hire just about anyone the starting rate at my warehouse robbinsville nj is 12 75 with a 50 cent raise for working at this specific location and another 50 cents for choosing the night shift there is some opportunity for overtime pay as well especially during amazon s peak season which occurs between nov dec the benefits are very good they offer medical vision dental 401k educational assistance and 4 shares of stock that must accrue for 2 years before they can be sold they also offer medical leave and an extensive paid leave for parents expecting childbirth the only other pro to this company is how they offer time off to their employees but eventually this system fails for many employees after a few months when you first become employed you are responsible for managing 3 types of time off you are allowed to use unpaid time off paid time off and vacation time while they start you off with an abundance of hours at your disposal improper use of this time will quickly come back to haunt you if you re not careful also if you go below 0 hours of unpaid time you will be terminated no matter what excuse you have for not being at work most employees staying at amazon for more than 3 4 months will find themselves with little to no time left to take off from work if they do not stockpile them where do i begin i m just gonna start rambling first off the hours are awful 10 hour shifts four days in a row really wear away at your tolerance of warehouse work at first i didn t think it would be so bad but the monotony of the job really starts to eat at your happiness personally i live 45 minutes away from the building so in total i dedicate 13 hours towards amazon daily when i add commute times this includes leaving extra early to get food i manage to get 8 hours of sleep but i only have a few hours to myself every day it s not fun you wind up being exhausted and sleep through your extra time you will not have any free time it s even worse when they add an extra hour every day and an extra day to your schedule during peak season with so many people in the building you re bound to get mixed opinions of them both good and bad the overall culture isn t so great since everyone is usually complaining about the job management isn t the worst but it could be much better there are often minor gripes among employees daily the job itself as a stower is the worst aspect of this whole job you re job is to take items off a cart and stow them into cubby holes for 10 hours a day if you have something next to you try picking it up and placing it somewhere else then putting it back where you found it repeat for 10 hours on top of that management will be disappointed if you don t achieve a certain rate per hour and will even take disciplinary action eventually i moved up to problem solver which was a more stimulating position since i used a laptop to fix any issues with the items that must be stowed while this was a more satisfying job management ended up screwing most of us out of the position by hiring too many and then picking favorites i went from problem solving almost every day to getting it once or twice every two weeks sometimes even less additionally problem solving is a position with a tier 2 salary within most fulfillment centers but the robbinsville location only considers it to be tier 1 there are many other issues myself and other employees have with this place but like i mentioned in the beginning it s not a bad place if you re looking to go elsewhere within a few months otherwise don t bother this place barely keeps employees for more than a year,at risk of leaving
the benefits with the exception of the health insurance are good the health insurance in the worst in the industry from what used to be the best salary is decent health insurance this benefit went from having zero premiums zero co pay and zero deductible to having a 3700 deductible for a family plan and then after paying 20 then to make matters worst they have added a very complicated and administrative intensive hsa to manage all of this your wife will not have access as it is tied to your corp account so you will have to manage it if you are used to your wife managing these types of things expectations the unspoken expectation is that you change jobs every 3 years or you are viewed as being dead weight it is exhausting so if you find a job you love and you are really really good at you simply have to leave could this be the reasons our products keep getting worse because the people who know them have to leave whether they want to or not stack ranking do not believe the hype this still exists they just call it something else and it is more secretive review system instead of 2 reviews per year there are a minimum of 4 but they are called connects now you only get compensation for one so they made something that was already a hassle and made it a double hassle everything you do has to have an immediate business impact so if you have a long term strategy or even short term say a year nothing you do towards achieving that goal counts because it does not have immediate business impact this all started under satya middle managers when satya came onboard there was all this talk of getting rid of layers of middle management so the real ideas could get to the people who needed to hear them this never happened every layoff or rif middle mgrs were not impacted and well known technical resources were let go this is a company that values non technical business school managers more than technical people very different than when i started and the reverse was true promotions you do not get promoted to a new job you only get promoted within your current job being promoted is actually a negative within ms for example if your job level ranges from 50 52 fictitious levels say you got promoted mid year from a 50 to a 51 you think great i am doing a good job then come review time you get a mediocre review why you ask i am doing the same work i was before same job management will tell you that now you are being reviewed and compared against others at level 51 so more is expected of you promotions can be used as a way to phase you out if they want you gone they can promote you to level 52 so now you either have to transfer or end up with poor reviews at the higher level i have known people who moved to jobs at a lower level so they had room to grow most people don t want to reach the dreaded level 63 or 64 i think which is where alot more is expected of you outside redmond if you do not live in redmond there are very few opportunities remember the move every 3 years do the math work life balance this does not exist you will be expected to work check email on vacations holidays etc and respond i will say that they are flexible about things like leaving early to go to a parent teacher meeting and things like that but you will work 60 hours per week and be connected to email 24 7 they do lots of lip service about how this will change but in the 10 plus years i have worked year it has not the trick is to take the popular vacations christmas july 4th then everyone else is on vacation so you might not be bothered company product info if you think you will have access to new products think again you will have access when the public does you will find out info when the public does external customers such as tap will know before you do mary jo foley will know before you do this applies to internal changes in upper management a memo goes out to the press the same time you receive it there is no level of trust there is also no internal system to share your ideas for product improvement there sort of is but it really goes into a black hole email alias nitemare want to talk to a real person about a problem you are having with an internal tool good luck you will have to send email to an alias and they will respond within 48 hours call the help desk our help desk the majority is in india in case you are wondering want to get a question answered about benefits again send email to an alias and wait 48 hours cost center do not work for a cost center make sure you work for a product team or revenue generating team if you work in a cost center they are always nickel and diming and it gets worse every year work for a product team especially one that is profitable and the champagne and caviar are flowing i could not believe the difference there are too many temps or contingent staff in my opinion it is just odd and they have important jobs and get treated like full time employees until their contract is up and they have to leave diversity if you are a white male look elsewhere this company is all about hiring females and non white employees for the sake of diversity ironically there are very few african americans here but people of other ethnicities change for the sake of change each fiscal year the manager s come out with their plans everyone throws their all into it then come june it does not matter because the fiscal year starts july 1st and everything changes even if managers were on the right course they must change for the mere sake of change or they look like dead weight don t our products do that too summary if you are a student or technical rockstar looking for a home this is not it this is a large corporation with all the politics that go with it and then some more bs specific to this company alone there are plenty of other options out there if you are gifted our just starting out the health insurance when it was good used to keep people here not anymore i am waiting for some stock to vest and then i am looking for other opportunities,at risk of leaving
amazon com is a strong business fueled by a virtuous cycle sales growth drives increased network density which improves cost per package fueling more sales growth aws is amazon s profit engine while growing rapidly and losing leadership to azure alexa is strong as well although also looking vulnerable to google with growth comes opportunity the workforce is young and high energy you ll find sharp folks in all organizations decisions are made quickly especially when reversible jeff is obsessed with delighting customers and long term in his thinking peers tend to be sharp but a step down from the other tech firms i ve worked for pay is fine comparable to other top tech companies but lower after adjusting for cost of living benefits are somewhat typical with the exception of vacation and sick days both lag behind top tech peers the seattle campus is beautiful and modern there are plenty of food choices including a good food truck scene the buildings are dog friendly which keeps things cheery i joined amazon because i found that jeff s leadership principles and vision resonated with me i find those principles poorly lived at amazon my impression is that the company grew too quickly and failed to maintain standards in doing so for some context i ve worked in high tech since 2000 and have worked for three tech titans all number one in their fields amazon has lower standards than all three i ve seen the worst tech of my career at amazon i ve seen the worst data data management and systems at amazon the comparisons are quite stark entire tech teams here would have been summarily fired at prior employers at amazon they linger despite low standards and repeated failures while jeff is quite long term in focus business unit heads can be very short term emphasis is placed on the number of projects completed in a given year congratulations on busy however very little planning is done beyond the current year and next to nothing is discussed on long term vision tech teams design to the current years projects which may not be aligned with the long term much of the tech work is wasted year over year rapid growth has led to a very inconsistent culture it s unusual to work with anyone who has been at amazon more than a couple of years what is valued becomes subjective with little in the way of common standards for employee assessment managers have nearly unilateral control over performance reviews which creates a culture of manager pleasing this leads to bad decisions as employees do not challenge their hierarchy hubris is the achilles heel of any successful company amazon is no exception folks expect newcomers to be awed i was but not in a good way i find the company does little to study and adopt external best practices the company practice of raising the bar with each external hire can mean you can find less capable folks at more senior grade levels don t expect your grade level to change as a result you can only be promoted within your current role if your boss is not interested in having you as a peer you ll have to take a lateral and then earn your promo there some managers do consistently push their teams to their physical limits health and marital problems are commonplace as a result i m the longest tenured team member at one year due to this the following three longest in seniority are all looking for other jobs amazon doesn t seem to see high turnover as wasteful nothing seems to be done with managers who have 100 turnover every year low standards leave little to learn from if you re driven by intellectual curiosity and personal growth you may need to look elsewhere,at risk of leaving
this is for the distribution center my experience wasn t horrible the management that i dealt with personally were decent for the most part when they bothered to remember me it s 12 hours a day once

ever you were funneled in to park to one of the only 2 entrances at the front of the building because unless you get really lucky or get there 2 hours before you have to actually be there you aren t parking anywhere near the entrance so that s one but primarily it s the way the people working there are treated they don t care about you simple as that of course one could argue it s not their job to care about you it s your job to do the job you re hired for and there are valid points along that line of thought however they could treat their employees more like humans and less like cattle or prisoners don t expect to have much time or energy for anything outside of work it s not that it s a difficult job in terms of how to do it it s that they run you ragged so that by the time you get home all you want to do is sleep on the plus side if you want to lose weight it s pretty much perfect you won t have much time to eat and you ll be burning every calorie you might take in before it has a chance to settle anywhere you can talk to the same manager every day for a week be off a day wear something different the next day in and they ve completely forgotten who you are there s no structure and no communication between different management teams you can be sent on what is supposed to be a quick side task and the manager that sent you to do such and such disappears the rest of the day so you re left wandering around but you can t go back to your dept because they ve already pulled you out of it you don t get to choose what dept or position you get it s based entirely on what they need or think they need the day you start along with however many 100 others that started the same day and once you re in that dept that s it there s no getting out i lucked out and got a fairly decent job in packing however a friend of mine who started at about the same time as i did was stuck in picking well with all the running and sweating her asthma kicked in she was taken out in an ambulance at least twice in the same week when she asked to be moved to a different dept smx s response was no maybe you should just quit so like i said they don t care about you in the least and at best you re a nuisance if you take any issue with anything at all breaks 2 ten minute breaks and a half hour lunch minus the time it takes to clock out go through security and clock back in you re down to about a 15 minute lunch and depending on what dept you work in you can forget those 10 minute breaks as that will affect your quotas for the day they use a point system the clock won t let you clock back in early but you best not be even a minute late or that s half a point so plan on spending 3 or 4 of the remaining 15 minutes of your lunch standing at the clock waiting to clock back in but you aren t allowed to stand at the clock they dock points for everything and you only get 6 to begin with no cell phones or that s an immediate termination seriously their excuse is they think you might have stolen it so they have to check it against the 1 million cell phones they house at the facility right because it s no problem to sign up for cell phone service just anywhere you happen to be when you run across one for that matter i could have stolen my shoes or my jacket or anything else i m wearing gonna check those items against your inventory too if you have kids or anyone else that might need to get hold of you in an emergency you re given a help desk line to give to those people the catch is no one is ever around to answer the help desk line quotas every dept has a quota 135 boxes per hour was the minimum in packing and every item that goes in each box has to be scanned with faulty hand scanners that either don t work or want to scan everything they come across if you can t meet the quota you re out so next time you order something from amazon and it looks like it was used for a football it s because of the quota that packers and pickers and everybody else there have to keep up with it s insane dropping the quota just 10 would save the company a lot of money in damaged items and returns because less of the packages would be getting thrown around by their distribution workers and they could take a bit more time to pack a box carefully i m not joking when i say that if they could use cattle prods or whips on their workers they most definitely would favoritism they have this thing called vendor bucks and contests to win various prizes like game consoles tvs etc based on production i think they were even giving away a car at one point but it all comes down to what dept you re working in if you re not in the right dept or working the right line forget getting a shot at those contests if you re newer than the rest of your team forget getting a shot at those contests as a lot of them are based on monthly or quarterly rates if you get sent home early because your dept is slow that day and there isn t enough work for everybody you have to have your badge scanned then sign out on an early out sheet with smx and there s no guarantee that even after all that you may still lose a point for leaving early even though you were told to it happened to me twice on top of all that the pay averages about 10 an hour no benefits after taxes for a single person you re better off picking up tin cans or mowing lawns you ll make more and you won t be treated like cattle or a criminal on the plus side they hire anybody that can pass a rather extensive criminal background check and a drug test regardless of your work experience or work history so there s really no excuse for most people to not get a job there but don t expect it to be easy and don t expect any kind of respect i did it for a short time because i needed the extra money next time i ll definitely plan better and look elsewhere but honestly it makes me not want to buy anything from amazon in the future because i know how they treat their employees for amazon to be as huge as it is it could come up with a much better system than what it has,at risk of leaving
fast paced culture where you have the opportunity to experiment and launch new ideas and innovations without bureaucracy generally ideas grow organically vs are dictated from the top down which is a great opportunity for those who want to experiment with new products and features test them iterate and scale success is dependent on your ability to iterate and scale products vs nailing it on the first launch if you are fortunate to work for a high quality manager you ll learn from the best in the business the environment is extremely intense and suited for those who can withstand a high pressure environment intense scrutiny and long hours it is a great place for a new hire mba to learn and grow or more senior level executives director and above to reap the benefits from the stock based compensation plan the best strategy is to enter amazon as a new hire mba build your skills with different industry leading products and technologies and move on by year 4 for experienced hires your ability to advance in your career is 100 dependent on the networking skills of your manager their experience with the process and the quality of their writing due to a highly political subjective promotion process there are no defined career paths for advancement and movement within amazon is lateral versus upward the compensation you negotiate up front is critical as raises are meagre even if you are a top performer and there are no annual bonuses there is no real incentive to be a top performer but a large toll it takes on your health and personal life many of the tenured employees seem to idle as average performers while top performers leave for larger external opportunities the revolving door is real at the pm level as a result of limited onboarding support poor quality managers and the frugal environment where you are expected to deliver more faster bigger with less it is difficult to understand how a frugal company is willing to absorb the costs associated with the constant attrition,at risk of leaving

great people great experiences some very good management ambition of the company is vast great technologies great working environments very international i enjoyed my work you work really hard its quite intense and you have to be confident of approaching lots of people you don t know and building networks across the business you are well paid and benefits choice is great there are opportunities for training you have to seek them out other than mandatory training such as diversity and equality and so forth in all i had some great experiences worked with great people and made very good money you can be in a situation where things are ambiguous you have to deal with that and if you don t you will have a problem some managers will leave you literally on your own and literally spend all their time managing up one manager i worked for for six months i saw her three times in six months it can be quite hard to get meaningful training as your workload is very high and unless you have a manager that wants you to get on you can run into a wall of indifference about your development if you have a quota focus on that to the exclusion of anything else don t let anything detract there are battalions of lawyers that literally hold things up and have no recognition of commercial deadlines processes are tortuous long winded paper and system driven policed by accountants lawyers compliance etc it can be very hard to make that process move and you have to build relationships to do that basic things like paying a developer or supplier in a country outside your own can involve conference calls to up to 15 people i left microsoft this year as a part of the large redundancy program 17k people overall when you leave there are loads of promises that you will be helped to find internal roles you wont be helped hr say this but you are totally on your own they also say they can extend your notice if you are in process for a role internally they wont they push the manager to make a decision literally after the interview they cant so you are unable to proceed a job i applied for which i had two and half years on that product line i interviewed for and all seemed well my feedback was one line and i didn t get it i then saw this job advertised two weeks later as a contract role with a staffing agency word for word the same job description at 50 of my salary they also say when you are leaving you can extend to cover stock vesting they would not extend me for 9 working days i requested this as unpaid i lost 14000 00 as a result hr are completely inaccessible you can only contact them via email they never call back they only do the absolute bare minimum and my advice is never expect anything from them at all ever and get everything from them in writing or it is meaningless ironically for the company that pretty much invented it internal tools such as getting access to resources finding data getting signed into programs and drives you need to access is again a painful process you have to apply for logins that take ages to get approved chase people to grant them and the processes can be clunky and slow for example any pay query goes to outsourced providers who literally ignore the query its all online the answers when they come are ridiculously inaccurate reflecting the total indifference of the poorly paid staff in india that have to process these queries finally i would say you will move almost every year and if your business unit is not doing well look to move in the fiscal year early as hr in their wisdom enacted the consultation period on jun 1st this gave 30 days and then your notice started july 1st which is end of fiscal year there are no jobs posted in july as all budgets come down 2nd 3rd week of july and new jobs are posted then you will be left with literally 7 10 days to apply interview and get to 2nd interview near impossible if you recognize your business unit is doing badly look around and get moving as your bonus job stock is always at threat even if you are doing well personally you can meet your target i did over 100 in first half of fiscal jun to dec business unit did badly jan to jun 2nd half of fiscal even then i made bonus makes no difference you are out don t assume you are safe as your business unit can disappear overnight i moved four times due to restructuring in five years ms corp in seattle is famously disconnected from international markets it is not a global company it s a us company that tries to force us centric models onto international markets quite one size fits all and as a result lots of head scratching when things don t work,at risk of leaving

working for amazon is great for the cv and if you can manage to stick it out for a year you will feel that you have performed a miracle most people don t last that long amazon truly did have the smartest people i have ever worked with sadly with very little social intelligence or any life outside of work no time to exercise socialise holiday makes you wonder how smart they really are amazon s long strategy to be the worlds most customer centric company is great but only if you are a shareholder or customer employees are chewed up exhausted and spat out before being replaced with a fresh mba grad with fat loan repayments to keep up no exposure to working for a decent company who think that the way people in this company behave is normal it is not every single employee in amazon is overworked and people are generally too busy to spend time with family friends exercise and have interests outside of work let alone look up from their screens to acknowledge co workers coming or going most workers eat lunch at their desk as they are too busy for a break the majority of employees would not dream of leaving the office before 7pm if you do this then your lack of commitment to jeff s cause will be noticed if offered one don t take a blackberry or you will never get away from the madness people who get on at amazon are aggressive know it all blame culture workaholics who will shift the blame on anyone but themselves and tear you to pieces as soon as anything goes wrong everything is a fire drill with people panicking and looking to apportion blame you either have to adopt some of this negative behaviour yourself or you will become mincemeat this kind of attitude would you get you nowhere in the real world but for some reason it is tolerated and encouraged at amazon just make you sure you unlearn this terrible workplace behaviour as quickly as possible once you have escaped i saw at least 4 people disappear during my time at amazon including someone who had relocated from abroad to work in luxemburg who was fired in the most undignified manner employees who relocate and decide to leave of their own accord will be chased to repay relocation expenses during an all hands meeting management sang the praises of people who had exceptional commitment to amazon one such person was specifically mentioned in front of the audience as a hero for still working from their laptop on an important project while next to the hospital bedside of their very sick child this said it all amazon is more important than you your health your family and everything in your life truly unbelievable and sickened me to the core don t be blinded by the rsus stock options most people don t last here longer than a year i heard internally that only 7 of people get the 4th year rsu pay out so you better be really happy with your base salary and uncompetitive benefits package 0 training budget and 0 chance of a pay rise during your time with amazon also don t forget that you will be working double the hours of a regular job and that combined with the fact that the cost of living is extremely high in luxembourg means your hourly rate will be peanuts i read the negative reviews before joining amazon and thought that it could not be that bad it is and more so don t make the same mistake,at risk of leaving

there are many things that i admire in microsoft in particular benefits package one of the best in the industry opportunities to grow by changing jobs internally learn to think big social responsibility microsoft is super generous to a variety of causes which is admirable very smart people easily approachable access to fantastic resources software library research etc very informal working environment flexible work schedule after having spent several years in different positions both technical and marketing i think this has been my best professional school microsoft has changed over the past several years and unfortunately not all of it is positive my observations if you get a first job there you ll probably come in at a very low level and you ll be stuck there for a while promotions are getting less frequent every year if you ve guts you are better off quitting the company become a vendor or do something else and be re hired as an external candidate you ll accelerate your career as you reset your history microsoft is an aggregation of different silos that don t talk to each other exec egos and turf battles come at the expense of the greater good the company is plagued with processes that makes it slow to react to more agile internet players if you re an entrepreneur at heart you ll suffer a lot at microsoft unless you re there for the enterprise experience and you leave after a few years beware though because the company is so big there are always pockets of excellence where things can happen fast those are usually the products version 1 where excitement and speed mean survival before the next executive review a large chunk of middle management is not hungry anymore if they have been there for many years they don t want to compromise their comfort they care more about their green scorecard than taking risks for the sake of moving microsoft forward many employees feel so passionate about their products that they live in denial that there is a world out there by closing their eyes to the reality they don t learn about what the competition does and what customers need it s easier to drink the company koolaid than make an effort to be self critical again don t judge microsoft just by looking at one group the silos are very different from each other and you may find happiness in another group,at risk of leaving
good benefits and reasonable place to work alhough to make good money you have to work the system by staying for an extended period and a top performer see below how microsoft has a calibration and review process there are also yearly commitments but they are a bit of a red herring although of course a newby has to actually do something initially but really the main work goal is to network with peers and anyone that can can give you a positive review remember you may need to reciprocate even if it hurts kiss up to your boss big time but remember he she also needs positive reviews and so work something out on that front the work is actually secondary to all this thanks to all the newbys and contracters who do that the calibration process actually determines what you will be paid and and more importantly if you will survive calibration is where you will be compared to your peers to see where you sit in that stack if you are bottom of the pile your are history and if you are top or near say top 30 you have hit the microsoft jackpot but the calibration process is a bit like a lottery as you you will be calibrated against everyone in your particular business unit at your grade by management that may not even know you and amay have there own personal favourites that is why networking is such a big thing the other part to this is there are quotas for each grade and there are currently 5 grades this like a budget plan 10 will receive 0 bonuses and increment and will be managed out of the company via a pip personal improvement program it means your gone and 10 will be marked as the top talent the others are the survivors with varying increments and bonuses depending on where they sat in the calibration the people that succeed at microsoft are not necessarily the most talented but the most able to work the system and have the most successful network to inflence the calibration an indication of the kiss of of death is to stay at the same level and role you are expected to grow and extend yourself most companies i have worked for previously would say if joe does the same job well and that is all he wants to do then perfectly fine but not microsoft assuming you stay and make it to a upper management level then will be a complete cat fight usually hidden from the minions you will be well rewarded well but attrition rates are higher look for the next vp leaving but still microsoft is very top heavy as has all those people that have worked the system but where do they go eventually get sick of it all and leave to start a contracting company or a business to add value to the microsoft products they have worked on and hopefully have left contacts in the company to get that work make sure you are working in a group that has business growth or else micrsoft has a tendancy to ditch products and people when revenue growth stops,at risk of leaving
one of the toughest work environments out there the pace is breakneck the hours are long and the expectations are sky high and ever increasing if you work here and move on to work elsewhere you will be very well prepared to meet any other company s standards what you ve heard about work life balance is no joke though a few years with amazon may do wonders for your career you should not expect to enjoy it it s a matter of priorities if you re looking for some incredible experience in an environment where you are constantly swimming upstream trying to solve almost impossible problems but hopefully somehow finding solutions then this may be the right fit for you if you value spending time with family and friends or leisure in general or even sleeping then you will want to think twice,at risk of leaving
benefits include decent discounts on products good employee paid benefits extras including healthcare rrsp s etc when i started with apple in early 2011 it was a very different culture than it was when i left in 2013 apple was a place that encouraged individuality growth creativity they also listened to concerns helped to take steps to find solutions act transparent with most issues and challenges this quickly changed as apple shifted gears towards more aggressive tactics to satisfy its growing customer base because of apples phenomenal growth and apples stubbornness to simply hire more employees they instead overwork the ones they have to absolute capacity until they either quit on the floor happened to four employees in less than a year or take a stress leave it turned to an environment which instead expected perfection at every move having a sick dad and a death in the family is not good enough for this company they expect you to suck it up and be a robot they foster an environment where employees actively give each other feedback however fail to notice when senior employees abuse this and instead bully verbally abuse newer employees who may not know better,at risk of leaving
the people all tend to be very bright talented and hard working there is almost no deadwood historically everyone made decisions based on the good of the company as a whole instead of what is good for their own teams the atmosphere was one of mutual respect everyone knew everyone as the company grows it feels like that closeness respect and shared purpose is getting lost still it is a good place to work in many ways the folks at the top are the best i ve ever worked for in the engineering departments everyone in management all the way up to the ceo is very technical you can explain anything to any of them without their eyes glazing over the fast pace means that you never get bored there is always some new interesting challenge in the nice to have category they have free lunches many people complain about them but i always thought they were pretty good they ll all provided by the same vendor though so it s easy to get tired of them the buildings are nice enough it is easy to get whatever hardware software or gadget you think you need top end mac or thinkpad with a giant display an extra desktop or two whatever just put in a ticket and you ll have it in a couple of days or sooner need some nice servers for your project a couple hundred cloud instances it s all available with minimal fuss when it comes to people netflix is a throw away culture most people last somewhere around two years before they leave or quit there seems to be no barriers to stop a manager from firing anyone that works for them if your manager likes you everything is peachy but if s he doesn t like you for any reason at all you re quickly out the door a lot of time gets wasted by new people trying to figure out how a thing works or more often just ripping it out and creating something new since whoever built it is long gone then these new people move on to the next company and the cycle starts again the high performance culture in practice means that there are very few useless people the downside is that you always know that your job is temporary and you re always worried that you ll be fired it s a stressful way to live netflix prides itself on being a nimble company it will occasionally do amazing things in a very short time period deadlines can be crazy and they often don t take into account other work that needs to be done projects don t replace the workload you already have they just add to it many times you ll deliver on a deadline only to find out that the work was unnecessary as someone decided to completely change the architecture or cancel the project completely everyone is assumed to be available 24x7x365 email is sent and replied to at all hours of all days and nights you can never let go of work lastly the company philosophy is to pay employees and let them decide what to do with the money so there aren t a ton of perqs for working there benefits are okay but not great no real gym membership onsite masseuses or anything fancy the whole company used to go to sundance every year payed for by netflix but they stopped that some years ago,at risk of leaving
culture hr employees most benefits pay problem was the job was exactly as described lots of walking many stairs and it was the 6 00 pm to 6 30 shift i thought i could handle it i was so very wrong wednesday from 8 00 am to about 1 00 pm no issues just how tos kinda things thursday was first shift they took us around trained us and gave us a tour very wearing 2nd night half way through the shift i had to leave i am no longer physically able to do this kind of job i think if it had just been a day job on the first floor i could have handled it would only have gotten 10 50 an hour if it was but a combination of being on the 4th floor and the walking and especially the time of night killed me i was feeling faint and disoriented called in the next morning and submitted my resignation went back a week later and spoke with hr because i was unable to give them at least a week s notice i will not be eligible for rehire at amazon for 2 years this does sadden me but there is no way physically i could have given them a week i will be losing the toe nails i know tmi on one foot and this is with good shoes and socks my body just rebelled against me of course i am almost 70 but i saw people handling the job that were 400 lbs i exercise i am not over weight and i walk a lot but that didn t help me bottom line amazon is a great place to work but be aware of your physical limitations if you are looking at a job in fulfillment walking stairs hours flexibility to change jobs give associates a chance to choose,at risk of leaving

i joined amazon about 2 years ago and like most i read the reviews on glassdoors and got so scared amazon is a big company everyone that has worked for large companies knows that there are always the pockets of bad teams or bad match between a hire and the company now it s also more common for people to write bad feedback than good feedback as an example it s rare to get out of a good experience on a restaurant and go write a good review on yelp you will usually go and write a bad review when you didn t like something back to topic i m having an amazing time at amazon i manage 2 teams of developers haven t had any attrition the team is happy and all of us work normal hours we often have social events and there is very minimal top down guidance about how the team works and what we should focus on we build our own roadmap and think long term it really feels like working in a startup but much more stable if you have the chance of working at amazon ask lots of questions about the team you re going into be passionate about the space you re working and you will have a great time oh and if you by any chance join a bad team after 1 year you can internally transfer without any problems main cons is similar to what was i mentioned above there is the chance of joining bad team like in any other company at least remember that you can switch after 12 months,at risk of leaving
benifits free phone tablet there was nothing good about this place outside of the free stuff managers are just rediculous and staff is two faced they tell you to go to them if you need help when they secretly report to managers about anything and everything you do do not trust anyone here asinine writeups for things they do countless times such as a manager daily would drop the f bomb multiple times a day and say other bad words as well when we get written up for an accidental slip up swear manager asked me if she wasn t putting out after i had a conversation with my female friend if i said this about their husband or wife i d be fired instantly manager would constantly harass me for asking questions when first starting employment then get angry that i asked questions just wanted to make sure i did my job correct i have aspergers when i confronted the manager who harassed me i was told i m not thinking growth mindset and it s my job it s my job to be harassed because i asked questions terrible i have two jobs working 6 am and microsoft all the way till 10 pm they would hold me later at night because they wouldn t have their stuff together and would make people go on overtime when they aren t even suppose to very unorganized so i get 5 hours of sleep because they fail at their jobs manager also would complain i wasn t following the steps of service which i did by the book got a 10 10 review as well as a full attachment item and they still complain never would they try and give positive feedback when i asked about the feedback problem why they are always negative they say i can t take constructive criticism it s always negative even if you do things right over 70 of the employees there hate it and are only there because of the company benifits most are looking for a new job manager would make non racial problems into racial problems because of insecurities i was discriminated agaisnt and even told them of my aspergers before applying to the job one thing that really blows my mind they tell you to enforce a no chair policy when sitting near xbox section when i enforced this policy the customer was unhappy about it and i was written up for talking bad against the customer when i never said any word to him all i did was ask a manager if they needed to be moved to confirm what they told me before this place is a joke the turnover and employees is a joke they leave and get fired because this place is run by jokes retail management wad the worst here than any other place i worked for,at risk of leaving

lots of opportunities to learn and move around some really awesome people the downside of which is they don t stay at amazon the extremely high turnover makes it really hard to just do your job let alone do it extraordinarily well the lack of depth and breadth of knowledge because most people are new means you get a lot of wrong information wrong answers and spend an inordinate amount of time just chasing down basic information to do your job lots of time wasted spinning your wheels here since there is little to no institutional memory we don t want people sitting around collecting a paycheck and doing nothing until they retire like some companies but we have the opposite problem and it makes it super hard to get things done as well it s likely someone else has already thought of done what you re doing but because of the silos there s no way to know that thus more spinning of wheels and then reinventing those wheels when someone else probably already did it better faster or did it and failed and there are good reasons why no learning at amazon because we turn em and burn em so much incompetence at amazon that so called hiring bar is such a myth constant excuses for incompetence top among them being so busy and new both are always true and always going to be true so let s just remove that from the equation and don t grant the premise if you re going to espouse a bar then hold people to it amazon does not there is very little accountability people leave on their own performance issues are not dealt with managers refuse to take ownership and deal with it but just wring their hands and say i don t know what to tell you or make an excuse for the incompetence and everyone else is left to clean up the mess then they get sick of that and leave amazon development and ideas happen in silos so no one knows what anyone else is doing i can only imagine how much money we waste on reinventing the wheel just because nobody knows what anyone else is doing amazon thinks we re in the business of everything everything has to be done in house with again a myth of we re so unique no we re not amazon does not need to write our own software for everything which is full of bugs because it has to go out right now and as a result is crappy and not maintained because people leave amazon and there s no support for the crappy tool someone wrote before leaving amazon amazon com may be the best thing since sliced bread but under the covers it s unbelievable what a mess it is and how little amazon appreciates all the worker ants who make amazon com be so amazing,at risk of leaving
the starting salary is extremely competitive the hiring pipeline is also extremely efficient empowering amazon com to court and successfully hire some of the smartest professionals out there unfortunately those are the only positive thing i can say about the workplace itself outside of work when you aren t getting paged up the wazoo by legacy applications no one in the company has any idea about life is awesome seattle is a beautiful city with plenty of culture and no lack of things to do a nice side effect of working at a place with insanely high turnover and high starting salary is that you end up with tons of young professionals all new to the same environment and in the same stage of their lives if you re one of them there are plenty of people to meet and hang out with amazon does not value its employees and this severely affects every aspect of worklife employees are treated as replaceable renewable resources not as members of a working team to grow with the company the focus is on new hiring with the expectation that any semi intelligent employee will leave within the first two years new hire salary is incremented at well over 2x the rate that top members of a team are given raises new folks regularly make 5 10k more than their tech leads who are the highest contributors on the team breeding poor sentiment promotions are easily promised during crunch times requiring 100 hr work weeks and just as easily forgotten when promotion or bonus time actually does come around additional responsibility both in person and in project management are regularly compounded upon top contributors without promoting individuals to the authority such a position requires making it difficult to get things done in a culture where cross team cooperation is like pulling teeth in terms of quality of work there is no value given to developer time and no emphasis on the importance of infrastructure build tools are down daily and ownership is a lost concept scapegoating is a regular occurrence when site wide post mortems require heads to roll few things are properly documented rarely anything is qa ed and as all original product engineers tend to leave within two years nearly everything is a legacy application the product development lifecycle emphasizes pushing new features products out quickly leaving little or no time for qa cycles the same engineers who coded the features under crunch are sometimes asked to do qa sign off yet when they come back to management with lists of blocking non blocking bugs they are asked to hide the lists and just to provide the sign off the result ends up being shoddy services held up by a company of already overworked engineers serving constant on call rotations who know they will be paged but even knowing this are rarely able to figure out how to even begin debugging the systems when i joined every single person on the previous generation of my team had left i later discovered that this was a regular occurrence which had already happened for the third time all the great projects and career opportunities i had been sold on before joining were back burner items reserved for interns and other people they had yet to sell a permanent position to regular employees were delegated to continuous on call rotations for applications no one knew anything about and left to debugging bugs hardcoded years before the overwork stress and lack of self fulfillment created quite the back stabbing team in my first week as a new hire i was angrily told by my mentor every time i sit down to get something done you ask me a question later the same day i was told by my manager so i ve talked to the team and they say you never talk to them or make use of their expertise you simply putter in a stuck corner when you could just ask as my time there progressed i regularly discussed the lack of opportunities and the disparity between my expected and actual roles with my manager who always promised clear action items to address my concerns none of which ever happened when i found a new team where i thought i could make a greater impact my manager blocked my transfer going all the way through hr to accuse of poaching when i tried to leave the company my manager tried to delay my resignation good stuff,at risk of leaving
some incredibly smart people to learn from good benefits pleasant surroundings very much a fear based company has entered the inevitable downward spiral of once successful companies and doesn t seem to know how to stem the tide let alone reverse it employees are picking up on this more and more like most of corporate america ms has made employment almost all about what have you done for me lately you re only as good as your last accomplishment and can t bank accomplismentrs beyond your manager s whim co emphasis on work life balance is in practice a joke they ll work you to death and call it a normal part of the job co is ovverly reliant on the whole you need to manage your own career mantra sure we need to do some of it but you need to help more because after all aren t we there to work and not constantly be looking over the fence at the next oppty which impacts our current job awful review process others have already explained it s the elephant in the room everyone knows about it complains privately and loses sleep about it but is discouraged from challenging it no matter how hr tries to spin it everyone knows it s a biased broken system in place to favor the few far too many gms with many who are clueless as to what goes on in their orgs beyond too many presentations from their directs and openly play favorites for all their talk about management skills ms has an incredible abiliity to hire and promote managers with poor or no people management skills since this is a soft skill ms places too little value on it but boy do they miss the mark here it has everything to do with the all important bottom line again lip service by upper management on how vital it is but in the trenches it s shocking how far people can climb without knowing how to manage people to communicate with their workers notoriously bad at not seeing the big picture when it comes to internal ops or long term impacts to customer sets would rather throw something on the wall read spend to see if it sticks then to step back and study the situation before acting if ms were a small company without such deep pockets they would have bankrupted themselves years ago doing this shockingly little sense of roi politics cliques favoritism all rampant and slow the company s output productivity and employee sat more than management cares to admit far too much lip service to wanting to change and improve and no consistent will to do it since ms has made working there an almost strictly business proposition that s what i ve done in self defense i m my own business i may work for ms but handle my career strictly in how it benefits me and not the co and like so many before me i m looking to leave despite the econonomy of course i keep my quiet about this like not announcing a product release too early and can t wait to hang my shingle elsewhere,at risk of leaving
you get to fly business class on international trips but in return you have to work 14 hour days whilst there so many but here goes most employees are brainwashed to the extent that you have to question whether you are talking to a real human being with feelings and emotions or someone you know is so manipulated that you have to watch every word you say you have to join conference calls at 11pm 1am 3am 4am 6am you have to join them they tried to curb it but nothing changed and if you don t join you d be told off for it no matter the circumstances you are called into meetings or have to attend other people s meetings i calculated the hours per week in meetings and on average it worked out at around 25 hours per week most of the time it s just another employee glorifying their own project which is nothing to do with you there is an awful culture of micro management everything is micro managed it makes you question whether it would be quicker if the manager just did the job but they re too busy so you re just there to handle the projects that trickle down that your manager should be doing the pay is competitive but competitive just means they re paying the same as other corporates that are under paying there staff there is no social life to this job no one goes for drinks or socialises with each other they re too busy or too tired from work it s quite depressing really once a week you get called into an all hands meeting where someone talks about how great we re all doing and every one stands there and claps in a righteous way it s like north korea you need to be on emails from 6am to 12am everyday if you leave work at 6pm you better get home have dinner and be expected to answer emails by 7pm you will be cautioned if you don t answer emails outside of office hours it still haunts me you never work outside of office hours well yes i do because i m on 4 hours of conference calls between 6pm and 6am and you don t pay for me working outside of office hours if you step 3 meters away from your computer without locking it you will be cautioned if you go to the sound system and pick a playlist that isn t katy perry or the weeknd then someone will scuttle over and change it within 30 seconds and i mean scuttle like a little crab the meeting room booking system is convoluted there are about 59 meeting rooms but you can t use them because they are restricted for more important people who don t use them i remember in the early days they said don t use linkedin or update your profile otherwise we ll know you re looking for a new job everyone is busy and stressed all the time it s not a nice environment to be in the christmas party was more like a funeral the churn rate is shocking people you just start to get along with just disappear and they can t say they re leaving so all of a sudden you re left with the old timers again whenever there is a live stream from cupertino you have to stay late and watch which would be fine if they attempted to make an effort to keep us in until 8 30pm but they don t you sit there in these really uncomfortable chairs and there s this one person who goes woo when something is announced when most of us just want to get home to our families everyone is so serious all the time hr should stand for horrendous robot because that is what it is you log a ticket then if you re lucky you get an email from someone who didn t read your ticket and can t speak to them and it takes about 10 days for a reply every time remember you are just another cog in the machine so you don t have the right to one on one support for hr for a company that has the most money in the world you d expect the best benefits in the world but if anything they re average at best when you read a review saying the benefits are good it s because they re better than some laundrette in kansas if you have a family please don t bother they don t care that you have anything else important in your own life but apple i probably don t have to mention this but i m putting it in for the keywords there is no work life balance there s work and work i ve seen apple employees at a gig sneak off to be on a conference call,at risk of leaving

many of your co workers will be intelligent funny people who are a real pleasure to work with and to get to know you ll be able to tell everyone you know that you work for apple which carries a certain respect with it your healthcare benefits package will be excellent you ll never have to use a pc at work first of all despite what you re told at hiring events and new employee training you don t really work for apple inc instead you work for apple retail which is for all intents and purposes an entirely different company there is little to no career connection between the two and retail employees are looked upon as second class citizens by corporate employees your chances of getting promoted from apple retail to apple corporate are no better than they would be if you worked for anywhere else in fact they might be worse the day to day routine of working for apple retail has some significant problems you can expect that your needs will always come second to the needs of the business in fact anytime you hear that phrase be prepared for the next sentence to describe how you re going to be screwed for example i m sorry joe but the needs of the business dictate that you can t take a vacation between october and february or june through september or well the needs of the business mean we can t give you a fixed schedule your schedule will be erratic you may work from 2 pm to 12 am on tuesday and be expected to come in at 8 am the following day if there s a product being launched iphone ipad etc you may be asked to work overnight to set up the store then come back in the next day and work another shift sometimes you re asked to work straight through during normal weeks your shifts will often be right in the middle of the day leaving you little time to accomplish anything before or after no scheduling preference is given based on seniority family considerations or any other factor any and all time off must be requested in writing often several months in advance but your schedule won t arrive until a few days before it goes into effect long stretches of the year are blacked out for vacation time due to the needs of the business favored employees will often be given a pass to take vacations during this time especially senior managers your coworkers will be neatly divided into two groups those who are able to rationalize any decision made by apple inc and those who understand the company for what it really is there will be many more of the former than the latter if you re a member of the relentlessly optimistic tribe you can probably do very well in apple retail if you re not be prepared to hear impromptu speeches about how apple products change and enrich people s lives and how amazing it is to work at apple many of these people will be older and some will have either failed at or quit other careers to sell computers for a few dollars above minimum wage which adds an undertone of desperation to their happy message if you find yourself in the less optimistic camp be prepared to be part of a very small minority and get ready to hear about it when you decide to speak your mind in fact don t speak your mind overall apple retail is a place that spends a lot of time and money to promote the idea that they really care about their employees one of the first things you re given when you re hired is the credo card which lays out all that apple retail stands for and believes in the very first line of the card is at apple our heart and soul is our people but what you ll come to realize over time is that apple retail doesn t care about you at all they care about making money and above all pleasing the customers and that s it if you hope to have a long successful and rewarding career at apple retail you d better really love retail for it s own sake loving the products isn t enough in time you ll grow to resent them you need to love all the complicated illogical arcane intricacies that make up the american retail model if you do you ll probably do very well at apple if not it won t be long before you ll be looking for a way out,at risk of leaving
great people that are smart and are capable of doing the position generous with relocation benefits very nice stock offerings the first week of training you meet 50 new managers and make some really good friends then 3 months later you attend planet of the ops and get to spend another fun week with the friends you made the first week overall it was a regrettable experience and only served to make me regret leaving my previous job and appreciate what i had before from the beginning i was lied to about what to expect and told things that enticed me to join them i had hoped working there was a great as being a customer after you get through their intensive interview process you will feel like it is a great place to be and that it is everything that you wanted in a job after they moved me and started at my sight i realized i had made a mistake that was only within the first 3 weeks of being there associates and mangers are treated as numbers your input is not regarded in any decisions and you must accept whatever senior management wants if you are a leader that cares about the people that work for you this is not the place to be everyone is treated as if they are disposable during my time there i saw approximately 30 managers leave from various levels that equated to an almost 30 40 loss in management with the losses no one was replaced and the work volume was dumped on those that remained when new managers are brought on they send them to a one week training at another facility with 50 other managers to prepare for your new job the week there is great but it truly does not prepare you for the madness that is to come every week they have 50 new managers in that training what does that tell you that they can hire 50 new managers every week and continue to always have open positions they will say it is all the opening of new fc s and constant promotion to higher levels but the reality is attrition i asked specifically during my interview and that is the response i got so if you have read all of this be careful what you wish for being employed there is not as great as being a customer,at risk of leaving
in management compensation is aggressive for people coming out of school as area managers the salary is high for a first job for professionals coming from another company field they tac on a robust signing bonus that gets baked into your salary for the first two years stock options vest after two years 4 day work week in most cases with 3 days off in a row benefits are good and on par with any good company a lot of opportunities for growth not necessarily as a leader but in position and pay if you play the game if you are willing to relocate which they will pay for and you are well liked you will get promoted simply because there is that much need because of the company s growth first i ll say that there is not a strong company culture so the experience can vary greatly depending on the senior leadership team of each site my experience is from oak4 which is literally the worst fc in the company to work based on employee surveys firstly job specific training was virtually non existent the first week of training is geared at showing you each part of the operations from the associate s perspective you will spend time actually doing each of the repetitive tasks that associates do every day the second week is leadership training but not for your specific role they just go over things like how to log on to vpn company videos and where to find certain resources after that the experience can vary i showed up to my site with no welcome and told to follow certain people for extended periods of time there was no circling back or review of learnings it was literally follow this person and pick up what you can there was not a big investment made many said it s because turnover is so high but i would argue the reverse that turnover is so high because of the lack of investment while the pay is good the 2 year bonus is there so that you have to aggressively try to move up there really isn t a place for someone that doesn t want to get promoted so keep it to yourself if that is your reality trust very few people and work to parlay it into a better opportunity within the first two years would be my advise after two years when the bonus runs out it won t be worth it get your first vest and be ready to move on the 4 day schedule can change quickly and fairly often with little notice some sites rotate it regularly on a schedule and some just change it based on needs most sites do front half sun wed and back half wed sat days and nights a lot of people don t like nights and most don t like back half but with both of those the crazy goes away a bit as a consolation prize the 4 day thing can temporarily go away at the drop of a dime if business needs says that there needs to be a 5th day senior leadership will make the call the lead time on this could be as little as a day and it could go on for weeks at a time same with longer shifts associates work 10 hours so as a leader expect an 11 12 hour norm due to pre shift and post shift meetings when the associates get put on mandatory 12 hour shifts naturally it extends the leaders to 13 14 hours this can be mitigated but not avoided even if you work very efficiently you will fall in this range if you don t it ll be even longer there is not much true leadership development development often is learning new things and becoming more of an expert about the operations however not much in the realm of real leadership development that will be transferable and helpful in your career after amazon obviously this depends a lot on your supervisor but it s not made important and therefore difficult to do even if the desire is there due to competing demands you will have to manage much more than you lead there is extreme micro managing and constant bullying managers get things done out of fear of consequences not of a true belief that what they are doing is the right thing the amount of unnecessary email communication is frankly ridiculous you will end up deleting over a thousand emails a day no exaggeration the important stuff is mixed in there so get control of that quickly through rules and email organization while it is possible to avoid the overwhelming volume often encourages people to log on often from home and get the emails sent to their phone it s a personal choice very low integrity in terms of reporting 80 of the people pencil whip 80 of the reports trying to do it the right way will extend your hours and add a lot of pressure from an hr perspective it s tough as well not a strong hr culture and i found that most of the people were just overmatched in terms of what they were asked to do it s pretty scary the things that went on from inappropriate relationships to flat out lies and integrity issues this was the scariest part of my experience as i felt that it could all come crumbling down,at risk of leaving

i got hired right out of college i would recommend any college graduate to start their career with amazon because it will teach you the work ethic you need to survive in the real world this work ethic will carry with you for the rest of your life and anything you do after amazon will be very easy to you you will work with very smart young leaders my gm was not even 30 and he had moved every couple years for a promotion opportunity there is a lot of growth if you are willing to come in everyday and work hard work week in the operations department is 4 days but i would say that i only worked 4 days 50 of the time i was at amazon during peak prime you are working 5 days in my building a lot of managers were leaving either getting promoted or quitting the company so most work week were 5 6 days 12 hours amazon also gives you a lot of flexibility on how to manage your people you get about 200 associates to manage and you can really set those relationships early on so that your shift can produce overall i had a good experience working for amazon i left because i found a better opportunity else where in terms of work life balance work life balance average work weeks are 50 60 hours and weekends are the busiest as it is with any retail sector culture everyone is a number to them from your associates to managers turnover is so high that anyone can be replaced after one year in my building i was the oldest manager intense work you are constantly on your feet while you are at work majority of the times i wouldn t even have time to eat lunch your ops mgr s wouldn t remind you to take lunch because they couldn t afford to lose you off the floor for even 5 minutes leadership your site lead gm changes every 6 months so everything that you have been working goes to trash once the new gm comes usually the gm doesn t know what they are doing so you go through a rough patch whenever their is change in leadership promotions if your building is doing bad as far as productivity goes you will never get promoted it took me over two years to get promoted from mgr i to mgr ii even though my peers which weren t good as me got promoted earlier in their careers because their building was doing good,at risk of leaving

compensation and benefits some projects you have to be very pushy to get the interesting work and work life balance if you have management support always had a sense of pride working at microsoft i worked nearly 10 years at microsoft and always looked forward with optimism to working with intelligent dedicated hard working coworkers leaders and on cool projects however i mainly i saw poor middle management dysfunctional teams constant re orgs back stabbing empire building and cost cutting that during my time i was reduced in force twice on two teams the first time i landed a new team and never left the company the second time i wasn t given such luxury despite getting 1s and 2s and promos over the last few years i left ms with a bitter feeling that i never found what i was looking for i met some very intelligent people but seemingly most had significant character flaws that were disastrous to building high performing teams what frustrated the most was the constant empire building and self preservation that occurred at middle and upper management levels basically what they tell you is just lip service to make you feel good but no substance not uncommon at big corporations so that shouldn t be a surprise before my second rif i had two teams interested in having me move but my last gm pleaded on two occasions that i not leave so thinking i was favored by him that would mean a brighter future so i stayed yet not 3 months later i was axed with 4 other coworkers best i could figure is that we weren t diversified enough to keep despite all being top team performers with important projects not sure who or how the layoff decision was made but from my perspective when you have common traits as far as gender race sexual orientation you don t stand a chance if you are in competition with the more uncommon folks working next to you even if they perform worse honestly 4 individuals on that team who could be classified as diverse had either delivered nothing of important in years stayed in the same role for many years or actually screwed up to cost the company money probably not an unusual situation at large corporations since meeting certain diversification requirements are important to someone up high so for me it s time to move on to a smaller company,at risk of leaving

if you read previous reviews you will see several common themes 1 interns or junior people with no or limited experience usually write about quick learning yes you learn quickly at amazon as the amount of work that a regular employee usually gets is 2 4x more than at other more employee friendly companies in other words your learning process is a multiple of workload and time spent at work in addition you will have to catch things quicker because you will own your area of responsibilities which is a good thing if your previous experience and skillset qualify you to own that otherwise it is usually trial and error learning while amazon does not tolerate any errors in other words you will learn something but as soon as you make a mistake you will become history through the performance improvement process pip process the question is why you would not learn at another company at a slower pace with manageable workload and at least some training support instead of self learning through internal wikipedia and waiting in long lines to business intelligence office hours or something similar 2 some people write about good benefits if amazon is the only employer in small town it is probably true however in terms of base compensation it is usually below average the stock part of the compensation is deceptive given that the average employee retention period is now less than a year and you will need to work several years to fully vest that amount even if you literally survive at amazon all those years the amount of stock is still below the cumulative amount of annual bonuses that you can earn at other companies that require to work 60 100 hours per week e g investment banking and management consulting there are no other perks because of the frugality principal 3 some people also say hat it is good to have amazon brand on their resume many people who have never heard stories of their friends and relatives working at amazon believe that the company is as good to its employees as it is to its customers customer obsession is what drives recognition and appreciation of amazon s brand however whenever i speak with random people in seattle all of them tell me the same thing amazon is the least popular employer in the area it is famous for making its employees overwork and for its high turnover if you get an offer or you are in seattle area for your interviews go to a local grocery store or a coffee place and ask people there what they think about amazon i wish i did the same due diligence when i came to seattle for my interviews 4 innovative projects are something that some people also mentioned in previous reviews amazon is a laggard that usually does reverse engineering of consumer products that other more innovative companies pioneer the innovation part is how to make those products cheaper by using cheaper materials or reducing functionality 5 all those smart type a personality people at amazon is definitely a bundle of joy in particular when it comes of scarce promotion openings the value proposition of working with smart people is not to compete with them but to learn from them you will unlikely have a chance to have a mentor or have decent team work to learn from your peers as amazon culture is very individualistic mainly due to the ownership principle my key point here is that amazon is not a sustainable company as it is depleting not disrupting the fundamental levers of its business model 1 it is eroding prices at the expense of its short term profits and most importantly vendor s margins if you are a part of the company you are also responsible for that consumer paradise bubble in other words if you don t cut down trees in amazon forest the one in latin america you are still socially responsible 2 amazon is depleting talent a key factor to drive company s success the retention rate at amazon is most likely the lowest among all american and global companies there is no retention policy well thought promotion programs and succession planning moreover the company is constantly hiring people to more senior roles from outside not only to support its double digit growth but also to close a lot of vacancies i witnessed situations when my teammates quietly left on friday and on monday we found out that they had quit without saying any word to the rest of the team it never happened to me at any other company i worked the key question is when candidates start avoiding amazon the part of talent depletion is also a sexist attitude to women that is actually common among all technology companies there are very few women in general management roles including product management merchandising marketing hr design and administrative assistance are traditional places for relatively few women who work at amazon check it out on linkedin by typing for example amazon marketing and compare it with results of amazon product manager i personally joined as product manager hoping to develop new innovative products but for some reason my hiring manager gave me marketing merchandising type of responsibility without any prior consultation with me i also felt that if i had children it would be almost impossible to compete with my teammates all of whom were married men with housewives taking care of their children when i started having health issues after all nighters 100 hour work week and stress i was even punished for taking several hours off to see a doctor spent time with the 911 team and missing the deadline for submitting a non critical write up of a sop to my manager same band as me on friday night for 15 min 12 15 am instead of 12 00 am while being officially on a sick leave at a hospital i could not imagine of being a working mother at amazon and taking time off to attend a school event or staying at home to take care of my kids it was a definitely the most inhuman soul crashing experience that i have ever had in my 10 year career depleting talent also means a lack of trained managers although there are special trainings for new managers there is no upward feedback system or evaluation to keep management skills at a certain level most of managers hired externally are usually young in their mid late 20ies or early 30ies so they don t come with a lot of management experience moreover the ownership principle relieves manager s responsibility for subordinate s failure to some extent as amazon s ownership term is individual s not team s attribute 3 amazon s internal operations are inefficient the company is well known for counting seconds of associates movements and installing cutting edge robots in its warehouses to save pennies while its internal management reporting system is far behind of company s current state of development there are a lot of disintegrated legacy databases and tools that require manual work imagine thousands of amazonians writing the same sql queries and waiting for hours to get them completed in internal data warehouses instead of having dashboards with more frequently used queries and preloaded data that is available immediately the data management system and subsequent decision making are the biggest weakness of amazon it is probably why many amazonians work those crazy hours and where a significant part of amazon s profits invisibly drains in addition if you join amazon be ready with a lot of manual routine work regardless of where you are at a warehouse or at a global headquarters in seattle and what level of seniority you are at associate analyst or vp finally amazon will expect you to have bias for action that is often confused with a lack of prioritization do it now do it quickly as a result there are less strategic priorities well thought decisions and higher probability of mistakes those mistakes can be very expensive and they also have a significant indirect impact on the above zero company s profits finally amazon is obsessed with its customers but it is a one way street the company adopted a very reactive approach to communicate with its customers we noticed received one complaint from one single customer that you overpaid for this item on promotion here is your money back

if you are a young single person very early in your career you will get paid double what you would elsewhere and learn a lot from smart colleagues just be sure to get out while it s your decision and before you burn out so you can take your knowledge and experience to a company with work life balance read the reviews on here they are an accurate cross section of experiences that show the reality of working at netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager you will have zero life outside of work and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer let alone getting fired recognize that you yes you will very likely be let go abruptly within your first year sometimes in a matter of weeks with no opportunity to improve at the sole discretion of your manager who him herself may or may not be competent or honest be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search political backstabbing is the order of the day the meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesn t scale ask anyone who has been at netflix in a leadership or cross functional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done and finally if you do survive beyond the first year don t expect pay progression they will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already over market,at risk of leaving

easy to make friends when you re under fire all the time most peers want to support each other because everyone knows you get no help coming on board and yet are expected to get up to speed quickly you ll walk away feeling like you re always watching your back but in a twisted way it helps you clean up your act and become a better employee and happier person grateful for the next job that comes along after the amazon experience looks good on a resume there s much about amazon that can t be attributed to other tech organizations amazon succeeds at establishing a unique culture emphasis on cult recruiters get frustrated at not being able to get candidates to follow through with the interview process once their friends at amazon find out they are interviewing phone screens are a big part of senior sde s jobs because of the revolving door of employees on call rotation gets tighter because whenever someone is fired or leaves the team needs to bring newbies up to speed on call duties mean no outside activities 24 7 for one to two weeks unless you plan to take your laptop every place you go for this reason most people don t have a life outside amazon required to be online working on a problem within 15 minutes of being paged means you are tethered to your computer for about one quarter of your life new employees feel great about getting through the lengthy interview process but in a few short months realize what they ve walked into lots of turnover in general but especially in management many are just freshly minted mbas who have little management experience and want to prove themselves by being good yes men or henchmen often they blow it with good employees simply because of their incompetence at handling people some managers are technical project managers with no people skills who also lack sufficient technical skills to be good tech managers because they lack technical skills on par with their staff they can t participate in secondary on call rotation making the teams even more miserable the worst of the lot are managers with a little bit of technical knowledge who put on a good show managers rarely say thanks except to give credit to engineers who are self promoting often taking credit for ideas their peers came up with the more desperate someone is to hang on to their job the more they badmouth co workers to gullible managers easy to manipulate newbie managers by camping out in their offices and making yourself sound knowledgeable and important hard for managers to detect bs if they don t understand the work of the people they are managing that leads to some really bad decisions that create outages and miserable on call rotations meetings become shout fests hours of meetings are devoted to people talking about things they don t really understand hashing through screens full of data staring at graphs managers like to make you feel vulnerable and on your guard by picking on small things like the style or length or content of your email makes you want to keep quiet and keep your ideas and opinions to yourself the more vindictive managers will go into your interview transcripts yes they keep data on everything and record whatever you say during your interviews in order to throw things back at you later why is this worse at amazon because of the constant churn of management and staff average length of employment is 14 months stock isn t really worth anything because your starting salary is about 10 less than your current salary the recruiters will tell you that you ll catch up to your salary goal within two years but the reality is that you ll probably quit before then they count on that in fact if you quit before your first anniversary you will have to repay them a prorated amount of your signing bonus and all of your moving fees if they decide you are not a fit they will harass you until you leave so that you return the money and they don t have to pay unemployment compensation total reliance on data means that you can t make an intelligent argument stick unless you can come up with numbers but more often your opinions are dismissed because everyone thinks they and everyone else are too smart anyway politics are rampant say the wrong thing to an ambitious senior manager and you ll find yourself a target for the next culling,at risk of leaving

working from home is great no commute and little downtime the perks discounts and benefits are amazing customer service metrics are geared solely on the customer s satisfaction with your service however customers leave feedback about apple services products as well as issues regarding connectivity within chat that are outside of your control your measurement of success is not based solely on your performance in rectifying an issue or providing accurate knowledge your measurement of success is not based solely on your demeanor and handling of the customer as a result metrics are skewed and regardless you are held accountable for performance of these metrics additionally management seems to be lead to or trained to make you believe that all accountability for metrics is based solely on your performance i have worked with apple for two years plus now and simply cannot understand this method management will use scare tactics to make you believe that your job security is at risk while stats are low even if all dissatisfied surveys are based only on the disconnection of the chat before you even get to speak with the customer which is out of your hands ultimately management is also untrained in the use of apple products and doesn t seem to have any positioning statements or training that help you to improve your performance at the end of the day i have been ultimately dissatisfied with my experience in this position and i m actively looking for a position elsewhere i ve seen a lot of turn over and as just an example my entire team has changed during my stay at applecare i have tried to apply for other positions which i am more than qualified for several times but never get a response,at risk of leaving

amazon offers the ability to switch teams pretty much at will so if you get bored you can find a new challenge design culture is nascent at best and design focuses solely on visuals the company has no focus on design whatsoever and the culture around design has worsened over the last few years as more and more designers that lack the appropriate skills have entered into the upper levels of design who lack ux skills but easily get by at amazon due to a general lack of understanding of design and product throughout amazon engineers are very talented but amazon lacks strong front end engineers the role is literally just now being created and has not prioritized ui developers at all this makes it even more difficult to partner with engineering who runs most of amazon as none of the engineers share a similar viewpoint since the majority of them do not have front end skills product management is similar as the majority of pms at amazon are glorified business analysts who are tasked with writing documents strategy is always secondary at amazon as wefollow a shoot fire aim methodology and just hope that all of the random things we do add up to something we can sell if you re a design pm front end engineer or anyone looking to grow a career in product i d suggest working elsewhere a few team hcd edg and maybe one or 2 others have a stronger product culture but it is incredibly rare to land on a team where product matters in the slightest,at risk of leaving

the insurance is the best i ever had i have no copay i only pay my 20 regular doc or 30 specialist deductible and everything else is covered 100 i had a baby and i only paid 20 total i had another surgery which cost 35000 and it only cost me 30 total the pay for the amount of work is not good read below the pay is less than normal for all the goals we have to complete we have to make sure we sell the applecare protection plan to at least 3 customers out of 100 must maintain customer satisfaction goal of 80 hard to do if customer gives a bad review for something you can t control for instance if a customer calls in since their brand new computer is broken and you refer to the store to get it fixed they can give you a negative survey which in turns makes your stats come down now management wants you to explain why they didn t approve of your service etc even though the calls are recorded they implemented a new call strategy called h2h it entails me asking the customer permission to ask them questions why do i have to ask them for permission if they are calling for help empathize with the customer never enough empathy on your weekly reviews per manager determine the customer s state of mind and talk to them dependant upon their personality i must align myself with the customer never do it since i have no idea what i am actually doing assure the customer their issue will be resolved and make sure to clarify their resolution you have to make sure you solve at least 70 of customer issues hard to do when the computer needs physical work done at the store maintain a customer satisfaction goal of 80 also hard to do when you get bad surveys because a customer was out of warranty and didn t want to pay for support 19 you also must make sure your calls are around 14 5 minutes long too short you re in trouble too long you re in trouble dont expect to have a life mandatory ot for christmas and other holidays also when there is a new product release good luck having a vacation during holiday time while on the phone you get a call around every 8 seconds so it s hard to take a breather you must type notes while talking to the customer so you can make sure to take another call if you don t hustle between calls you know what happens another chewing out by your manager to top it all off you have 3 exams to take that you must pass or get fired it s 8 hours a day training for 4 weeks if you miss a day of training for any reason you are fired you do 4 hours a day of instructor led training and 4 hours just reading your own materials if you don t read you won t pass and you will get fired 5 people from my team didn t make it lastly don t expect to advance quickly most managers are promoted at an average around 4 years the bad thing is they will give a regular employee backfill manager perks but no additional pay to help the managers out the backfill will review calls and critique your work and do the managers work most people never make it to manager even while backfilling a guy on our team has been backfilling for over 2 years they make it seem once you backfill the manager position opens for you but that s a lie they do a lot of external hiring for managers instead of inside last hiring spree they hired 4 external hires for manager and only 2 internal my manager has no idea how to do my job since he was hired externally he can t give me advice or pointers since he doesn t know i am in the process of looking for other employment opportunities but i will be replaced with the tap of a keyboard since most of my team has quit since starting but that s the way it is here,at risk of leaving

people are definitely the biggest pro to working here apple has the tendency to hire amazing people unless they do a mass hiring event and the family atmosphere is definitely there even if leadership is continually fostering negativity your friends are always there and you can t let them down despite being discouraged the benefits are also good they ve drastically improved the part time benefits and they re much more affordable the pay for what s expected of you is low of course the schedule isn t the best but it s retail you go in knowing this management at least in this specific location is extremely discouraging i ve been in two other locations and never experienced this almost everyone and i mean everyone i have positive relationships with about 90 of the staff neutral with the rest which consists of leadership and new hires i don t know yet expresses disappointment with their interactions lack of real acknowledgement and recognition and leaderships focus on negativity if you have a heartfelt opinion that you think would benefit the team and the business which i vividly remember apple as a culture encouraging this you re beaten down they accuse you of being negative lacking social tact quoted seriously and any chances for advancements quashed the leadership team picks favorites and fosters this strange environment that makes you feel unwelcome muffled and worthless they seem to not like older people particularly ladies which i think is due to the feelings of one manager specifically who is quite obviously a misogynist they also have a habit of creating their own policies outside of apple corp s hr rules such as vacations not exceeding 12 days even though you can take up to 14 almost everyone that s been there at least 8 12 months is leaving or actively pursuing opportunities elsewhere,at risk of leaving

i cannot point to the pay benefits or working conditions as pro s because they are all pretty terrible recruiting lies to and misleads people in order to get fresh faces in the door to offset one of the highest turnover rates of any company if i had to point to one pro it would probably be the availability of part time shifts that work well for those who are going to college full time as well as the fact that the pay is at the top of the scale when compared to other part time jobs like fast food or coffee shops it is the bonds i have formed with my coworkers as well as all the wonderful people i have met that have made the job tolerable and keep me excited to come back i highly suggest starting as a part time employee if you like it there are plenty of chances to move to full time or increase your hours imagine the worse manifestations of every negative aspect you have ever encountered at work and that is your day to day reality working at amazon in less than one month at the new dse5 plant in renton i have witnessed promotions being granted based on favoritism hostile work environments i have had a driver attempt to fight me by getting in my face and i have been consistently threatened by management it is clear that in a market which is being constantly flooded with desperate entry level workers from abroad amazon views their workers as glorified slaves if you are not capable of meeting rigorous time demands or unwilling to tow the line in an increasingly difficult and hostile work environment then you will become another nameless statistic and nobody will ever even notice that your gone,at risk of leaving

you ll learn a lot and its a growing environment i used to get really frustrated about the focus on frugality and the not invented here and build it over buy it mentality there however seeing how the rest of the work does it i m good with the frugal approach and building it and doing work most people out there do it via spending money on products to expand the domain of the it manager without any focus on the business and without any metrics for success amazon is the opposite fo that everything needs a cost justification and its difficult to build empires without any competency the topgrading environment is actually good in some ways because it does eliminate a lot of the people that you have to put up with at other jobs who are totally useless the bar raising interviews and stack ranking does actually mean that you might be working with a bunch of other decently talented people rather than trying to drag a department along single handed i usually get bored at a company after 2 3 years but i stuck with amazon for nearly 5 years before getting bored with it because it was growing so fast grew from managing 400 servers to 30 000 servers in 5 years at some point though i d learned most of the lessons dealing with scale and that exposed the fact that i simply didn t like working for the company or the upper management bezos in particular frugality get taken to an extreme it leads to bad decision making if the payoff cannot be measured if you simply argue that a technology will be able to be leveraged in the future and is forwards looking it will go nowhere with upper management although bezos gets to make bets like that but the engineer on the ground doesn t get to make that kind of call also the focus on frugality leads to lots of turnover with the employees as they get treated like replaceable cogs the topgrading environment is also a little abusive it doesn t allow for someone who is simply doing a necessary job and doing it well to stay in that job a lot of good people have been chewed up and spit out by amazon which increases churn they would also do well to relax the focus on topgrading without abandoning it completely,at risk of leaving

international environment billa downstairs metro right outside the office fruit day as i consider glassdoor a useful tool to get some information about the corp world i am going to be really fair on this one only if you are 20 yo and you have no experience in the corp world i would consider amazon prague as an option in this case 1 year in the office may be a good point to start having said this the prague office it has been the most childish and unprofessional work environment i have ever work for managers do not have any knowledge about leadership reporting don t even know how to do a vlookup in excel or people management they will postpone your 121 have no answers for your questions or concerns and won t be of any help they won t even be able to approve your holiday allowance as they are not allowed you might wonder what s their main duty then simple controlling what you are doing in every moment of your shift they will control how much time you spend on the toilet how much time you are having lunch for how much time you spend on meetings and so on if manager has the time during the day to be checking on each of his her investigators well it means they do not have other things more important to do majority of managers coming from countries outside europe with no previous experience working in this continent and with cero adaptability to the way we work in europe which brings frustration and misunderstandings whithin the teams as i mentioned your holidays will be approved well sorry rejected by a useless department called workflow which their main duty is distribute the workload between the qs the problem comes when they do it wrongly or the 3 departments on trms plus you will need to literally fight and even threat them to get the holidays you are entitle as per the czech law approved management will postpone every possible career development until they drain your energy and you decide to leave the company there are 0 incentives to perform well if you perform awful and do nothing during your stay nothing will happen to you you will not be told off if you perform extremely good nothing will happen either you will be happy if you get a thank you or a lollipop so with no economic incentives nor career development possible it is quite normal that people will leave after 6 months i could keep on writing much longer but it is not worth it my advise there are hundreds of companies in this city so keep looking,at risk of leaving
your hard work gets noticed by managers and tier 3s alike tier 3 is a position that is somewhat equivalent to an assistant manager at other employers but they directly manage the bulk of resources in the areas that they re assigned you can be trained in other areas in your working area if those above you think you can handle it at date of hire you receive up to 4 days off in the form of 1 10 hr block of vacation time 1 10 hr block of paid personal time and 20 hrs of unpaid personal time vacation time must be submitted for approval no less than 24 hours before the time you wish to be off the paid personal time can be used whenever you like and the same with the unpaid personal time you get up to two weeks 1 week of vacation and 1 week of paid personal and every quarter you accrue 2 extra unpaid days you can have up to 80 hours of unpaid time accrue before you max out you lose all of your 1 week personal time if you don t use it by the end of the year and my understanding is that vacation time can be accrued for an unlimited amount of time after your first year you receive double the amount of vacation time to accrue throughout the year remember all of that time takes the whole year to accrue so every pay period you get a little more that you can use in whatever type of increments you decide insurance benefits aren t too bad if you re single or have a spouse domestic partner if you have a family still not the worst that i ve seen but fairly standard see below for advancement and promotional capabilities amazon com is also great if you re single and or have a specific type of spouse domestic partner see below 401 k is pretty standard for the industrial warehousing industry after being there for predetermined amounts of time 2 years then 3 years you receive a few units of stock at both intervals which is nice see below you may receive a small monthly bonus based on the whole facility performance so that s definitely good see below amazon com also has tons of leave types available for emergency situations or personal issues but really could benefit from enforcing the laws concerning certain types of leave see below they also have an ethics line for employees who feel like they re being slighted or have seen something they feel or know is wrong see below tuition reimbursement wonderful amazon has a pretty good tuition program you have to be an amazonian for over a year before it can be used but they ll pay up to 12k for certain college courses usually a technical certificate or certificate of some kind it s supposed to be up to 3k spread out over a years time but they re pretty flexible on that because of the limited number of available programs that you can finish over a few years time period and they also pay for your text books related to the program classes you re taking really really nice pay isn t bad for a warehouse unskilled position either starting out see below in the end amazon com isn t a bad place to work it s really great for hardworking high achieving single people or people who don t have families or people with a college degree before you start at amazon as for the insurance benefits for a company the size of amazon com and with as many subsidiaries that they own they should have been able to hire someone who could have negotiated a much better deal for their group insurance rates for anyone with a family i ve worked at smaller employers with nowhere near the employee capital leverage that amazon com can command and they provided much better insurance for families or parents w children at much lower rates again as long as you re single or only have a spouse domestic partner and that spouse domestic partner is able to willing to move if you have children or your spouse partner can t won t move for whatever reason then you better have a college degree to move up within any real time frame in my 4 years of being at amazon com i knew of many tier 3 s who had been at amazon for 5 years maxing out their pay before they were promoted for me that s just too long to be in one place with less than a dollar raise per year to be on one position unless you were some one if the opposite sex of who wanted you to fill a tier 3 role that s right sexist behavior or unless you have a degree add that in and i ve known of a dozen or more who were promoted within 18 months or so that doesn t count the number of newly hired area managers that were only able to do the job because of the tier 3 s in the area and then still fail and before being fired start going on write up spree s to prove they can be better managers amazon doesn t have a formal policy for having to have a college degree to be promoted but even if you have more than a decade in direct management don t think you ll be promoted to an actual am position at tier 4 or above unless you have a degree the shares of stock stock bonus that you receive only twice as a tier 1 or even after being promoted to tier 3 employee is nice but tons of employers offer far better bonus options however tons of employers also offer no bonus options as for the monthly bonus that you may receive it s far from guaranteed and seems to be skewed to benefit employees who don t have children to take care of single parents or a handicapped sick spouse parent or have to have another main priority other than amazon if you use your unpaid personal time then the small monthly bonus that you may receive is docked by 50 use that time twice and you lose it as for leave different facilities may have different requirements for approving the leave forget that some states and federal laws require that it is provided in certain instances even if you have the correct documentation then you can still be denied fmla i know it s a serious accusation but it s completely true and their ethics line complaints well maybe i depends on who deals with your complaints but no one that i knew of ever was able to have anything happen unless it was a tier 1 who were sometimes fired as a result of theft as for the tuition education program it s not bad but changing it to allow for earning at least an associate degree since you can actually earn it from some programs or with some college from before amazon and it would really be great the pay structure is somewhat odd i ve worked with temps who have less experience and knew than me but made 2 00 per hr more than i did why i had more responsibility expected of me but i actually made less than someone who was able to skate by doing as little as possible making as much as possible amazon makes an attempt to vary pay increases by looking at other employers in the area and calculating other benefits giving an extra quarter sometimes less or more than that and one more thing if you think that once you re promoted to a higher position tier3 or up you could ever skate by with only getting your regular 40 hours forget it as an am or higher you hae to put in a ton of extra hours so kiss your kids wife and anyone else in your life goodbye,at risk of leaving

the name only the name the lie is that you ll get paid a ton of money the truth is its 100 biased on whether you manager likes you get rid of your re branded rankings the zero rewards is a scarlet letter and unfair it s a way to give people your manager likes even if they under perform a ton of money and leave you with nothing to force you to quit there s no way out of it none many of the managers are immoral and protected and they have all power in their hands with no accountability for their actions i ve even heard managers joke about it over dinner if they don t like you they will take all your credit give you all their blame and bully you until you quit i ve personally stopped 2 suicide attempts from manager bullying since i ve been here this is not a game this is people s livelihood i ve also seen people given offers to fake positions just to let go of them one month later into the new role look it up there is so much corruption and bias,at risk of leaving
great job for a student solid pay for how little you are asked of lot s of overtime available decent exercise extremely friendly co workers for the most part tons of time off music over the sound system not always my choice but varied so overall enjoyable warehouse temperature varies a lot hours vary based on volume some days they are looking to send people home after about an hour of work other days they are asking for people to stay 8 hours totally unvalued you want to call off work don t bother just don t show up and the computer will handle taking your vacation time off for you get sick don t tell a manager just clock out and leave it really makes almost no difference if you are there or not almost no advancement chances unless you spend an unreasonable amount of time in an overlooked position very poor training expect to learn the whole job on your own or by asking your co workers,at risk of leaving
great benefits good discounts pay is better than other retail jobs the job can be grueling career opportunities are held as carrots in front of aspiring employees to try and keep them engaged with little to no actual advancement potential no upward movement possibilities from retail to corporate regardless of experience all movement is lateral the quickest way to get an actual promotion is to leave get the experience elsewhere and then come back promotions that do come are often based on personal relationships with leadership as opposed to quality of work new employees can often make much more than you regardless of your prior experience,at risk of leaving

benefits here are great for both full and part time employees fun place to work even on the busiest days even the store meetings are fun and for the first 3 years i was there it didn t feel like i was just working retail it felt like i was part of something bigger and a lot better we had a change in management at my location and the turnover rate spiked for a long time the most common reason employees left was a promotion within the company but i saw more people leave last summer than i d seen in the 3 years we d been open i can t speak for everyone but for me it was depressing to check my work email after a few days off to find out another co worker was no longer with the team by the time i left it no longer felt like i was part of something bigger it was just another retail store with a revolving door of employees it s hard to feel like you re part of a team when your teammates change several times a month there were other changes i disliked but it s difficult to explain those without getting too specific and losing any anonymity glassdoor may give me if i had left a year earlier this review would be 4 stars and my only complaint would have been the lack of communication among managers but seeing things change the way the did has left me disappointed,at risk of leaving

ok pay 28k for a first job very fun and intelligent colleagues opportunity to create meaningful projects management is poor they seem disinterested in people management and would rather do their analysis work this leads to poor team morale the general feeling is that we have been mis sold the job it was pitched as a broad reaching role with elements of consulting and analysis the reality is that it is telephone sales and there are stringent targets that leave little time to do anything else the attrition is appalling i started with around 15 colleagues and there was three left after twelve months this is consistent with other departments the main reason for the attrition is the lack of opportunity to move up in the company there is one small promotion that is attainable once a worker has reached this level the job doesn t change in the slightest you deal with the same work and the exact same clients moreover they hire externally for managers who usually have an mba and consulting experience when this glass ceiling is hit usually after about 18 months there is not much you can do to further your career apart from leave there are a few other things that i find personally negative however these are the most pervasive,at risk of leaving

amazon s intensive interviewing loop means you get to work with incredibly smart people it s relatively non hierarchical in the levels below vp they give you a decent amount of autonomy in making decisions compensation is excellent it will quickly become evident that amazon s a great place to excel if you can literally devote all your time to it so it s great if you are in your 20s and have not commitments or if you have a stay at home partner holding down the fort for pretty much everyone else and that means for most women over 30 it s not a friendly place but i would think everyone knows that by now another issue that i experienced during my time there which was little over a year is the company s incredibly messy and convoluted internal systems for conducting basic day to day business tasks like processing a po or getting expenses paid or having a computer glitch sorted out i ve never seen anything like it at other companies the time wasted by senior level employees dealing with the lowest order tasks out of sheer necessity because there are no assistants and troubleshooting anything takes so incredibly long to say it s labyrinthine is an understatement as a marketer getting even the simplest marketing task accomplished involved dealing with a constant stream of blockers like endless calls with legal dealing with an insanely slow system to get any outside vendors paid in time and battling computer says no at every turn it s a complete paradox as on the one hand the company is all about thinking big but on a fundamental level they make it difficult for even very senior people to get out of the weeds of dealing with everyday minutiae this is why you end up needing to work such long hours as well because you re expected to not only deliver on your goals at an executive level you re also expected to be your own staff handling every little menial chore that someone many levels below you should really be doing i can appreciate the ideal of such a non hierarchical and self sufficient vision but in actual practice it just doesn t work anybody with a better job offer will of course leave that kind of situation it doesn t help anyone to be creative or feel they re using their time wisely,at risk of leaving

smart co workers having amazon on your resume can enhance your career opportunities from engineer to senior managers even pm none of them care much about ui ux quoting from the management i don t care about how the product will look like just make it work first we can worry about ui later speaking of working backward that company often encourage in amazon way is to write a 10 page of design document spend 10 hours of reviewing it rewrite your document several times because your manager doesn t like the introduction paragraph then later at some point someone says the navigation flow is not clear to me the attrition rate is ridiculous the people who did the welcome lunch for you most probably won t be the same ones doing the farewell lunch 50 of people leave within the first year 80 within the second from my experience i d say it s more than that instead of real engineering work if you prefer to spend most of your time writing emails doing operational work and playing corporate games to get the promotion then amazon is probably for you oh and good luck to stick with the same manager that can vouch for your promotion either you changed the team or they change the manager for you,at risk of leaving

i was at google for 2 years on 3 teams it s safe to say depending on what team you re on that ll shape your experience significantly i did have one team i loved one that i hated and one that was just ok so i actually a well rounded outlook of google pros is google overall cares for its people but it s the management that either keeps that up or messes it up you will work with the most brilliant people ever which is usually a good thing but it can also be a bad thing which i ll discuss below my work life balance was also dependent on the team you re on on one team i could barely catch up and another i was barely working 20 hours a week but did my job well of course the perks are great so i don t need to get into that on the worst team of the three my team was rediculously micro managed to the point that we would get in trouble for leaving our desks i got talked two twice and the third time i got pulled into a room with my manager telling me i had to work at my desk even though i was the top performer on the team there were major trust issues management is truly hit or miss my first manager was literally in meetings all day and no one got face time he ended up leaving because he ended up not liking it anymore second manager i loved and the team was perfect but she ended up transferring due to how she felt she was treated the new manager was terrible pulled down the morale and 3 people transferred out after 3 months third manager was brand new and no one trusted her 3 people left within 3 months good management is hard to come by competitiveness runs rampant to the point that people will steel your work if you bring it up like i did after seeing it happen to me 3 times management told me that s the way google grooms people and it makes people become competitive you re surrounded by brilliant people but the imposter syndrome is strong at google the way performance reviews are set up you always have to come up with random stuff to outdo yourself and make you look good that s good to push you out of your comfort zone but bad because people start making up useless things to show they ve been doing stuff it s silly really and this is why it s incredibly hard to get promoted is that you have to outdo yourself and outshine your peers my peers before me have been at google for 6 years literally in the same role even though they work incredibly hard and smart i suggest you do as much research as possible and google why people leave or don t like working at google so you see both sides,at risk of leaving
microsoft has a lot to offer to anyone looking to learn the business of big software development in my experience the biggest benefits to working at msft is the networking and organizational mechanics visibility you get i have met a ton of incredibly talented people who later on became important resources for future opportunities within and outside of msft it felt much like college to me a time to learn a lot meet a lot of contacts and grow as an individual the resources and opportunities are huge at msft though much of the time you realize you are a very small fish in a very large pond big aspirations can be squashed frequently after the reality of the organism that is msft becomes apparent but again the opportunities environmentally outweigh the unfortunate lack of ability for any one person to change the reality of what msft is a giant steam ship that takes years to make a turn the layers of buerocracy and management are the biggest downsides of working at msft it often felt like the job was much like the game show survivor where many of your co workers were trying to stair step over each other with every project the culture at msft is built to surface the strong type a personalities to succeed while the less interested or mellow personalities can be stuck for a long time in unhappy roles if your goal is to work with a team you can trust to focus on the problem at hand instead of their own career advancement opportunities to build truly useful and revolutionary products for people and you ike to have clear ability to affect long term direction msft is most likely not the place for you it is however a good place to learn a tremendous amount and move on from just be honest with yourself before you commit,at risk of leaving

netflix has nice fancy offices in los gatos they have good snacks they pay a pretty high cash salary you get to claim that you re in the movie business netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies they claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance and let the lowest performers go to me this sounded great in contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people unfortunately that s not what it was like in reality a week after i started at netflix the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed then the tech support guy in our office was released then an engineer on my team in each of these cases it wasn t clear what these folks had done wrong they had all been technically competent friendly and hard working this promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure it turns out that there were several things going on managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees so managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees in most normal companies a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management at netflix this just doesn t happen additionally netflix doesn t have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees in the year i spent at netflix i didn t receive a single review positive or negative without a formal system for employee evaluation managers resort to picking favorites they hire in their friends and fire people who they aren t friends with i saw this happen to many different people while i was at netflix it s allowable by law everyone is an at will employee but it does not lead netflix to hire and retain the best people netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business they moved early into online dvd rentals and have large cost advantages over potential rivals their competitors blockbuster walmart etc took major missteps and were not really able to compete netflix doesn t have to be the best at anything they do operations marketing movie recommendations etc they just have to be ok at these things to run a profitable business and they are only ok at them,content

like many of the reviews have already said netflix does offer some nice employee benefits especially the employee stock purchase program take a look at what netflix stock has been doing the last couple of years you ll wish you d bought in 2007 i ve met some great people while working there both peers and supervisors for the most part customer support is incredibly easy because the service itself works pretty smoothly when it doesn t cs reps have the power to make things right for customers which is fabulous unlimited time off within reason and when it s available is awesome ultimately the cons outweigh the pros i will be voluntarily leaving netflix for a new job in the very near future netflix treats employees like they re completely expendable i realize that no one is indispensable to a company but netflix uses up employees like i use up tissues when i have a cold the turnover is ridiculous and it doesn t have to be that way for cs reps the main statistic used to determine our worthiness is the dsat customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service were you satisfied with the call a no response counts against the rep even if it was something the rep couldn t control i m sorry it looks like your bank declined your card for this month s service fee or the customer was making an unreasonable demand i got a disc that won t play give me six months of free service or i m cancelling netflix s stance is that we should be able to sugar coat bad news so well that the customer doesn t hang up unhappy this method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps gaming the system to avoid no responses netflix does not give raises period not for cost of living not for length of time employed not even for outstanding performance i have worked there 3 years and my stats have been stellar the whole time so stellar i m one of the people they have trainees shadow to hear how to handle calls properly i have never gotten a raise monetarily netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training no paid time off unless i want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off mandatory overtime during the holidays they re promising it won t happen again this year but that s what they said last year and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter and the winter before extremely limited career options unless you want to be a cs supervisor you re pretty much out of luck at the call center narrow focus hiring netflix hires people with exactly the skills they need for a particular position if that position goes away so does the person there is very little provision for cross training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else trase one exception to the cross training policy has been trase which is a disaster so far trase combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention billing fraud shipping issues physical inventory problems and website content issues they all received cross training and even though there s more people to handle problems now cs reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue reps have to tell customers someone will get back to you within 1 3 business days what happened to one call resolution there s a guaranteed no response for my dsat thanks a lot workforce management can t seem to forecast how much staff is needed we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day and then a couple of weeks later they re offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts this is probably related to the fact that marketing doesn t feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute speaking of marketing they don t seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of netflix s operations the no credit card necessary for a free trial promo was a fiasco much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions the same can be said about some of the tests that engineering sets up on the website isn t it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out i realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn t but if a test makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain cs reps can t remove them from the test netflix is willing to lose the customer because that s a valid test result there has to be a better way the canadian service was launched prematurely in my opinion many of the calls we get from canadian customers center on the lack of content especially newer releases the canadian streaming library will grow just like the us library but that s not a satisfying answer to canadian customers thanks for another no response on my dsat marketing department,content
good exposure to large scale operations and high operational standards 2 years is enough to gain such experience if you haven t before working with highly skilled individuals everywhere mobility in meaning of moving between teams countries roles it worked in dublin office more than 4 years it is not a global company and i don t think they want amazon to be one shut down all offices except the ones in seattle today and it will continue 99 of its operations fine if you are not based in seattle accept limited visibility and slower career progress for yourself all the tools you will be spending nights to figure out are internally developed so there is no use of this experience outside except aws services you are exposed to due to internally developed tooling everywhere you will be working far from open source commercial solutions exist on market contradicting leadership principles allows your manager peers to knock you out or praise about you depending on what he she wants to do high performance culture is internally interpreted as step over others to climb up culture unless you are a genius if you are type of the individual a political animal who will not mind to crush anyone in your path to succeed amazon is a great place no one will stop you as long as you have enough political not technical skills to project how good you are and how bad others in your team are if you are type of individual who cares his her team and team goals you will be penalised for your good intentions in the process and when you question it you will be thrown at couple of leadership principles and told that your career is 100 your responsibility so unless you end up with a good manager actually good ones don t last as culture doesn t want them to be supportive and good to their directs you are always in danger and eventually going to leave office environment is pretty bad in meaning of positive energy burned out engineers who never smiles at work shouldering heavy on call duties due to duct taping approach to bad solutions everywhere anyone joins as level 4 5 engineer in an office outside of seattle should expect to spend 8 10 years to be promoted to level 7 principal even they exchange their life for it if you are not based in seattle accept that you will hear important details after you missed the opportunity to react or grab it and nobody will care as everything in seattle is awesome work life balance doesn t exist and it will drain you quick stress of covering your corner everyday doesn t worth it health insurance for family is not fully covered pension plan is below average 3 if you don t contribute,content
there are many but here are a few of my favorites play to your strengths too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses in hopes of becoming well rounded this is fine but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths where employees do more of what they re good at and less of what they re not good at in a diverse team i ve never seen this done as well as at facebook moving fast at scale there are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast as fast as any startup that s it awesome so impressive at facebook s scale world class team i know this is said often and loses meaning but it s true here every single person is both smart and nice a rare combination they care about the right things and don t care about the wrong things both parts of this are important too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn t matter e g who s invited to a meeting or whatever at facebook everyone is just trying to make a positive impact without care for politics etc things change fast if you re not at ease with change or if you re seeking a place that never changes this is not the right company for you this includes projects tools technologies teams there are multiple technical ways of doing most thing,content
flexible working hours so you can arrange the time you work satisfying salary especially if you are recruited through mach program friendly workplace environment no hierarchy chance to voice your opinions in all meetings nice place to work the office environment cafeterias are good too much expectations and high performance targets always feeling under pressure and salary increase pace is quite slow limited job opportunities turkey office is trying to decrease its workload due to bad economy conditions so if you are an intern it s really difficult to become a full time employee,content
overall people are really nice and are friendly to work with the benefits including work life balance and the opportunities to come in and go whenever you want is great the pay is pretty good doesn t seem like everyone is motivated to really bring great products and services to the marketplace everyone is okay with the status quo right now we ve been focused on maintaining services at a bear minimum no one is actively looking to move the needle and do something bold and creative the product areas always are lagging the competition,content
disclaimer my opinions reflect that of an sde in amazon seems like some operational job functions are very tough i have read through some of the other amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience this is so true within the same team you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together i think i am more of the balanced type as i try to stay sane the amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be pros in amazon certainly excludes great benefits but compensation is competitive free food means average quality free coffee once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch and free beer and finger food in special events we get a free orca card to take any bus in the seattle area for free 160 per month subsidy for office parking which is better than nothing downtown monthly parking goes for about 200 per month 401k contribution is 50 of what you put in where you can put in max 4 of your salary not so great staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food or could be even more expensive it is hard not to complain about the cafeteria vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves they count as part of your 5 personal days per year listing the benefits of amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros work life balance seems to be ok for the most part and seems to be individually driven no one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time i have team mates working every night and weekend and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm all in the same team managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working if you work 40 hour weeks productively you can definitely outperform someone who works 60 hour weeks but don t deliver stuff working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common but i can t say how many people are working how long the view on work life balance is a bit skewed all it comes down to are the managers and what they think projects are always never ending but i have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable without counting your nights and weekends getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment everyone needs a break on call really really sucks basically all it comes down to is having sdes double duty as support operations engineers note that on call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way the on call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons if the managers had given more time to up the quality there would not be so many problems software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years the code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in amazon searching through the amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse integration is the name of the game in amazon you will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team s services whether these other people are cooperative is a hit or miss i have found that most people are responsive and helpful but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody it is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow this reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit if the company does not make money where is our bonus going to come from you can see new faces around the amazon building almost everyday downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above average engineers and being an amazonian sde certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people i think the world is not turning up enough sdes and the only way is for quality to go downhill as an sde expect to spend most of your time talking writing emails and documents and maybe around 20 30 of your time coding in most of the teams you can work on interesting projects but probably not revolutionary ones note that amazon is a very down to earth company and the work is very down to earth as well you will work on real things that people have actually requested for and that people will start using as soon as you are done work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems to me this seems to make sense because i have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and i did not feel it was a good use of my time internal mobility is a key strength of amazon and i am not sure which company has done better than amazon in this aspect internal moves are easy you only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team there is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the bay area overall amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work the flexibility of this company is really its core strength you have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want bummer you shouldn t be slacking beware of bad managers and horrible team mates they are not specific to amazon but they do exist in amazon i have to admit that monday is usually a blue day at amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office i don t know anyone in amazon who looks forward to getting in on mondays be realistic about sde requirements coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job i think we are hearing the same thing from every company medical coverage is average or below average expect to pay about 60 per month for singles and about 240 per month for families 240 per month for families gives you 3000 in medical fees before you have to pay more anything out of pocket sde advancement is unreal difficult they have about 6 levels total sde 1 4 then senior principal engineer and finally distinguished engineer the number of sde 1s and 2s are huge trying to get to sde 3 seems to be all of a sudden extremely difficult but not impossible so this essentially means that if you come to amazon as a fresh grad sde expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality you will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else employee retention is horrible i am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources management all say that they are trying to retain people but actions don t seem to suggest anything better rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible this basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you or if you are smart you should not stay in amazon for too long,content
10 hr up to 20 hrs of ot a week and paid personal time breaks flexible offered a lot of upt pto voluntary time off chose my schedule only had 1 manager worked for 9 months she was really efficient ability to communicate with coworkers managers easily there s literally a search engine for anything you would need lots of gift cards for great work ethics prr working a lot of overtime etc crosstrained in multiple departments could be a con if you don t like the variety or the dept team meetings are entertaining helpful holiday pay training is quick it was fine for me you had many tools resources to help so it wasn t bad certain policies and things out of our control can make it a bit hard to keep every customer satisfied positive positioning is key,content
pays well for a csr job is full time immediately two week training adequately prepares you for position nice break area with complementary tea coffee fruit no dress code wear whatever you re comfy in friendly co workers pleasant work space comfortable desks chairs clean appearance breaks are csr responsibility you have a schedule but you decide whether it s best to go on break or take one more call on extremely high call volume days i e server crashes etc managers show appreciation by coming around with a cart of beverages and snacks to keep you going while you are placed on teams to help you deal with any obscure technical issues that may arise the teams aren t very supportive or responsive they love to bs in the chatroom but when someone asks a real question suddenly it seems like no one is home on the rare occasions when you do have an escalated call that you can not resolve supervisors avoid your messages in order to avoid dealing with the dissatisfied customer there is very little positive feedback on days when i did everything correctly 0 customer dissatisfaction by survey response low handle times etc the supervisor never said a word the moment you have a long call that pushes your time up they call you on it regarding any such poor performance it was very common for embarrassment tactics to be used in response instead of constructive criticism,content
similar to the current day technological evolution everything in amazon is moving in an extremely fast pace employees are free to communicate and share with each other and the management team with their personal opinions if the comment provided is good you will get a positive answer the workplace is very flexible and the new building is a nice place to work in everyone around you is kind and friendly willing to lend you a hand when needed the negative side of having a well paying job is that the working hour might interfere with personal life for example if you cannot get a job done in the limited amount of working hour it is expected that you will finish the job before the due day using your personal time another aspect of the negative side is the high amount of pressure involved in the workplace if you cannot do you job well or you are not as good as everyone else around you the chance of you been sacked is very high however these issues again might only apply to some people and some other might be cool with working under immense pressure and don t mind sacrificing their personal life for their job,content
publicly traded corporation billions in assets okay in other words it s a stable company you can say you have a secure job easy to get into i recommend waiting when they have a direct hire event to get in direct with amazon and not thru an agency you get all the good benefits health dental vision life 401k restricted stock units pto vacation unpaid discounts etc all on the first day of employment when direct hire the fulfillment center is high tech well ventilated and water stations are plenty to keep hydrated during job not much micro managing hr is easily accessible as they are on the floor nice cafeteria style lunch rooms with variable lunch options if you want to buy scattered bathrooms thought center as well what else oh and plenty of free parking rate i always said this job would be a keeper if weren t for rate or a at least doing a different job function where rate does not dictate you collecting a paycheck or collecting unemployment picking is amongst the demanding job functions in the fulfillment center as of late 2014 rate was 114 per hour meaning picking 114 items per hour for 10 hours shifts are 4 days 10 hour shifts with 3 days off back to rate rate is what you are in here you are nothing but a metric of performance you are to be treated as a robot area managers are always switched and almost always new so there is no building relationships as coworkers they are pressured to meet high production outputs or be fired so in return they have to eliminate the underperformed that s the way it is i say get replace workers with high tech robots and save yourself money and increase production exponentially rate is robots not humans at least humans who are intellectuals and are doing the job out of necessity and don t just have an empty head like most of the unfortunate youth in there,content

dont have to go far to find a warehouse very helpful and very nice coworkers a good workout where do i even begin i worked at amazon for 2 years and the things ive seen is just insane 15 minute break thats more like 5 minutes because to get to the break room and back is 5 minutes each they changed shift times all the time if you have a second job or go to school it makes it impossible to make it on time if they change shift times amazon runs on a flex up flex down schedule they can either add an hour to your shift or take away time from your shift depending on how busy or not busy it is management is full of idiots as well as the hr department i needed to take time off for surgery and hr said thats fine just bring in documentation after i get surgery they email me saying i can only miss 6 days right after telling me i can miss 2 weeks they then fired me and told me to return in a year they fired me because of missinformation they gave me they told me once your termination is in the system theres nothing they can do to change it see you next year bunch of idiots they also move people around the building left and right even to places that dont need help one time they moved an old man to unload a trailer by himself and management came over 2 or 3 times to tell him to work faster like seriously you couldnt find someone else in a building with hundreds of people thats who you pick,content
1 if you love tech this is a great place no doubt you ll talk tech mostly the msft stack from enterprise to consumer from pcs to phones to xboxes from datacenter to desktop 2 what were great benefits are now very good took a small step down but still probably better than you ll find at 99 of large corporations if you ve got family the value of the benefits is even higher 401k match is nice 3 even with it s struggles msft is still a cash printing machine this means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work you can have a stable job pay your bills feed your family and not worry too much about layoffs the stock you own likely won t tank but probably won t go up much either you ll get a bonus each year and some stock it s a decent life if you aren t looking to light the world on fire brand on your resume after many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there s 90 000 employees don t think msft is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies managing your career make you say this out loud so it registers 90 000 employees work there double that for vendors it is very hard to stand out and move up in the company don t expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too not familiar with the stack rank check out the 2012 vanity fair article called microsoft s lost decade,content
1 nice facilities 2 good food that s not terribly expensive 3 decent pay for a technical writer 4 people were fairly friendly on the whole 5 great fringe benefits for full timers not for contractors including a gym on site doctor and other services 6 you don t take your work home with you as a contractor 7 from what i can tell apple actually cares about its employees and it tries to be a responsible corporation that counts for something a lot really my previous employer was happy to support bigoted political candidates just for the pro business policies i don t see apple doing that i do see it giving me a place to safely dispose of batteries recycling waste on a huge scale and building giant solar farms 1 this was some of the dullest work i ve ever done at the austin location most work seems to revolve around helping apple associated repair shops do paperwork i wrote a lot of processes about things like explaining to an apple keyboard jockey how to replace incorrect serial numbers and how to document returned parts and so forth to support these repair shops 2 it can be impossible to get away from deficient personality types and that can screw up organizational functioning i had the misfortune to get saddled with the smuggest most pedantic and yet still unfriendly person i have ever met the kind of person who can t distinguish between can and may but who will take a paragraph to critique your use of who instead of whom the kind of guy who makes his neck tendons stand out from strain when he s trying to make an ordinary point about a slideshow in a meeting there s no need for that kind of inanity in a clock punching job anyway he trained me and occupied the adjacent cube during my entire tenure and because he dug himself in there was no way to get away from him even though it was clear to my supervisors and coworkers that this guy was an obstacle regardless of how hard he worked everyone hated him but there he is immovable 3 apple is byzantine more arcane than you d dare guess and yet there s not an organizational chart to be found ask for one and you get a weird oral history recounting the succession of lords and ladies in the various sub departments but not say a hierarchy of departments and brief descriptions of their functions this makes it unnecessarily difficult to figure out how the organization works 4 good luck getting access to the systems you need to do your job i never got access to some of the systems i was actually writing processes for many times unbelievable,content
the management really wants you to be the best you can be within your title before moving up to any other position they are very focused and dedicated to expanding your knowledge on all the products and give you time to study the products or anything you feel needs brushing up on they are very lenient with days off as long as you request them a few weeks in advance and they are very adamant on answering your requests within a day the pay is good for a retail store however for the amount of money the company makes mostly because of their retail store employees the pay should be more the managers for the most part care a lot about their employees and treat them like equals they are very friendly and helpful and good at listening and responding to the employees suggestions and feedback all the employees in the store really love doing what they do being part time felt like a full time job it was exhausting the customers although a nice chunk of them are interesting and fun to interact with are mostly annoying non english speakers who yell at you and get frustrated at you for not speaking their language the pay is good for a retail store however for the amount of money apple makes mostly because of their retail store employees the pay should be more the training is very tedious and time consuming for a retail store but understandable given the amount of customers and questions you have to deal with everyday,content

competitive salary and great benefits i relocated from a less competitive software industry in comparison to puget sound so i m probably underestimating a good living there are a lot of cool things going on at microsoft it feels like you re entering a pretty special company given its track record regardless of anyone s strengths or weaknesses you ll encounter some pretty smart people here and it feels good to work with capable people there generally feels to be a high standard of technical understanding without penalizing those who don t know everything most managers and peers are friendly and helpful the facilities are modern and clean with amenities you should have just about any resource you ll need to do the best job you can microsoft is a 10 ton behemoth with who knows how many teams products and organizations it s unreasonable to believe you can be satisfied with your job just anywhere enjoyment of your job is highly dependent on what team you re on and the specific things you re responsible for some organizations are bound to aging tools codebases and other technical debt issues that can make work stressful and uninteresting on the other end there are teams building bleeding edge tools and services that you can nerd out forever on,content
good salary good benefits the opportunity to work with decent people management that so far is uniformly bright and pretty easy to work for easy going in some respects corporate culture it is like any job though follow the rules and you will have no problems the problems start when you don t reach your assigned goals and metrics the metrics for at home advisors are not overly strict nor impossible to meet all you have to do is show up do the job according to established practices and trust me once you start doing that it gets a whole lot easier and your metrics are met the company is fun to work for you get gifts every quarter nice apple branded clothing high quality commuter cups and water bottles sometimes you get silly things as well but that s just part of the fun of working there the training for at home advisors is about 5 or 6 weeks long and it is kind of tough it s not impossible but it s not easy either the overall atmosphere is fun and it s fairly easy going as well working from home also has the benefit of being away from office gossip and office politics in addition there is the employee purchase plan for apple devices and all kinds of discounts on other stuff as well apple builds their support around empathy and building a relationship with the customer so they feel as if they are getting personal service from you it s a good thing too i have done tech support in the past both face to face and over the phone apples formula for doing things while hard to get used to for the cynical is really an effective way of dealing with customers there is also plenty of opportunity to advance and move into a full time gig also your manager is their to support you all of the managers i have had have been involved encouraging and supportive but there is no hand holding you are expected to take what you have learned and help customers now don t mistake that as meaning you are on your own with no support quite the opposite there is tons of support but once something is given to you to do you are expected to complete it or accomplish it in the agreed upon way there are no excuses your manager is there to support you help you sharpen your skills and give you some best practices all of my managers came up through tech support going from tier 1 to tier 2 and then moving in to team managers they have been there they know how it works and their knowledge is what will help you get to the next level constant team leader changes i am now on my 4th team manager in 18 months all of them have been good so far but it does get a bit old hours and scheduling can be a bit crazy you have to bid your shifts properly so you get what you want one day per weekend is required and that is your 8 hour day you are generally kept at 20 hours a week if you take the benefits in my case it s for my entire family anywhere from 25 50 of your paycheck is gone benefits however are good customers oh the customers they can be draining some of them are literally emotionally involved with their device i kid you not i have had customers crying because their apple product is broken and not working many of the customer in fact the majority of them are intelligent and given to following instructions but as with any other call center job there will always be the difficult ones,content
as a company in many ways amazon is quite amazing they ve had success in multiple verticals and are continuously expanding into others if you re working in one of those new verticals it s exciting to see what will come out of it people are getting more excited about amazon because they are taking bigger swings whole foods online pharmacy twitch etc from which they have a compelling foundation to build off of e commerce which is different than other big tech companies the stock has been soaring and general sentiment of financial analysts have been good the company is continually expanding within seattle is opening a second hq and continues to grow internationally overall there s always a feeling while working at amazon that something crazy new or exciting is happening somewhere people teams and organizations work in silos this is common at large companies but the degree in which it happens at amazon is extreme i can count numerous examples from the different teams i ve been on and worked together with in which people on the same team are completely unaware of what each other were doing the worst example of this was two different product managers on the same team getting two different sets of engineers to accomplish the same exact large scale task this is so engrained into the amazon culture that people will see situations like this laugh it off and accept it as normal many people still save design source files and word excel documents to their computer and share them out via email if you know to ask to compound this problem amazon is so freaking cheap that they give all employees 1 gb of email storage which is less than basically every free email service provider in the world cloud based and collaborative work processes are still foreign concepts to many in amazon engineering is clearly more powerful than product and design and a lot of time on both product and design teams are wasted because engineering has final says on almost everything a lot of the existing internal tools and infrastructure at amazon are created and designed by engineers without the end user in mind this has been normal at amazon for over 20 years and isn t changing without some kind of high level intervention because of that the only teams with decent design teams and designs are in the most successful consumer facing products the e commerce site devices lab126 amazon video and amazon music don t even bother joining other design teams if you care about making good designs amazon s strength is e commerce so they have a poor foundation for serving up digital services communication social productivity etc like the ones google apple microsoft facebook etc have many digital services and products that aren t tied to the e commerce site are inferior in engineering product and design the quality of life at amazon is poor compared to other companies you can work at i haven t seen instances as bad as the new york times article where people are crying at their desks or screaming at each other but there are definitely many people who are grumpy or frustrated you are expected to bootstrap and be self reliant it really comes across as an excuse to do the bare minimum to support employees company training for new employees is half a day long and then it all depends on what your organization and team have set up for you if they set nothing up for you well you re on your own this would be more acceptable if more it support and security staff were more helpful many not all are disgruntled with a poor attitude however these employees are also just given the bare minimum to accomplish their jobs so they have some right to be moody the bootstrapping mindset the lack of resources and support the focus on doing more with less and the overabundance of work has led to a culture where people don t actively help or collaborate with one another because they have too much to deal with some people are genuinely nice and want to be helpful and collaborative but they can t because they re too busy then you re left with the jerks who don t want to be either and don t care if they set up giant roadblocks in your way to get anything done the leadership principles are celebrated by employees but are easy to be interpreted in multiple conflicting ways like any other cult or religion what is deemed right usage of leadership principles is mostly from those most charismatic most experienced or most masculine most of amazon s leadership posts are held by men who ve been at amazon long so the leadership principles skew heavily toward masculine values and mindsets uber s former cultural values and former ceo were heavily influenced by amazon s and you can see where that got them the frugality leadership principle gets ridiculous to a point where they will save a couple bucks even if it means giving employees more headaches an easy example of this is not stocking certain cables with it or even basic supplies in the office supply rooms sure you might save dollars on not buying them but if your designer product manager or engineer need to leave the office to buy some you re actually losing money oh and that dumb 1 gb of email storage it tells you to essentially adopt an ocd email management approach in order to fit into the 1 gb limit are you freaking kidding me,content

the people in applecare are generally very friendly and supportive management usually does a good job in letting you balance your work and social life they will usually help you find positions outside of applecare should you want to leave but still retain employment at appple in some way applecare really can be a fun and rewarding place to work but be prepared to be stuck in practically the same job forever there are basically two levels managers and everyone else if you don t want to be a manager you will find almost no opportunity for job growth at all applecare can be a fun and rewarding place to work but be prepared to be stuck in practically the same job forever there are basically two levels managers and everyone else if you don t want to be a manager you will find almost no opportunity for job growth at all the large amount of cash apple has accumulated over the last few years has not really been redistributed to the employees in applecare if you are an exceptional performer the biggest raise you can expect is only about 5 or 6 percent though they tend not to lay people off which could be considered a nice trade off,content
i ve been with apple for a couple months now as a specialist basically the front lines of apple retail stores the workplace is great the people are super friendly even though i ve only been there a short while i ve already made friends within apple employees are very open and helpful to newbies they ll role play with you give you feedback about how you re doing and suggestions for improvement and on my first day my colleagues even inited me to lunch with them which really helped break the ice and made me less nervous the pay is decent managers are competent and considerate and you really feel like you re part of a family like any retail store you occasionally have to deal with arrogant stupid and belligerent customers it works out well though because the other employees and managers are very helpful in dealing with the aforementioned customers the pay isn t great but i d say it s a little above typical retail hourly rates as part time you don t get health benefits until after you ve been there for a year,content

the money is decent and the hours are okay you might also get in shape you will hurt yourself even doing things the right way and the management will try and make it all your fault i even got a verbal warning for time off task when i threw out my knee trying to satisfy my jerk of a boss and i was on light duty the quotas that they expect you to meet are completely unrealistic and if you try and discuss it with management they just say well such and such makes quota yeah well not everyone is cut from the same cloth some people can work super hard and only pick 985 items a day instead of 1000 punishing them for it is discrimination if you pardon me when you don t make quota they will treat you like even tell you you re not trying i busted my butt for this place and got treated like a lazy teenager who was just looking for an easy buck i saw lots of hard working people get fired by management who didn t even know their names much less how hard they worked what s worse management will tell you hey were here to help we re here for you if you have questions or concerns bring them to us then when you do they talk to you like you re dirt make up excuses lie roll their eyes these are bad people who have learned to sound friendly the company destroys peoples bodies psyches emotional health and self esteem and then acts like their pathetic for not being able to take it of course management can screw up be lazy fail whatever and it s perfectly okay there are policies of zero tolerance and zero accountability avoid this company and don t buy from them amazon is what is wrong with america,content
1 in my case timings were alloted as desired 2 daily target can be achieved by woking only 1 3 rd of your capacity rest you can earn respect by performing sincerly 3 your nice deeds and good habits along with your performance are considered for the promotion take the prescribed break only without exceeding the specified time limit 1 hr our of 9 hours is break broken into 3 intervals and be on time always this will add up too 4 there will be a feeling of ownership in you at amazon workplace if you really do understand it 5 you are not allowed to work extra at your own discretion so this will curb exploitation of you fellow associates the performance matrix is calculated only for the hours you worked i e if you were off work due to other official reasons or extra curricular activities your matrix efficiency will be based only upon the time you did your job 1 the light work doesn t apply for all and there are people always busy and running around 2 your freedom is somewhat tied with your manager some managers are less strict and even award ample leaves if you do work on tine and sincerly while others never get satisfied by the work you do and may even force you to work more however note that you will get extra pay for each hour you work overtime and in my case there is not much work so forget about forcing they won t even grant you overtime unless it is really required even if you ask for it,content
there are some very smart people here and some very interesting technology lots of fun techie toys to play with in the course of your job and a decent amount of support sometimes for doing things in new and better ways the pay is decent if you can avoid getting screwed over by the recruiter when you first start work life balance is typically respected and it s extremely easy to get time off or work flex time when you need to the locale is good with lots of things to do when you aren t working plus you get to make balmer chair jokes the review and promotion system is pretty obviously designed to pit employees against each other like grading on a curve which makes no sense if you want to hire a bunch of really smart people and keep them all motivated and happy management is fumbling and confused and seemingly care more about making one or two feel good changes they can put their name on and leverage into a better position elsewhere than actually improving products or the business oftentimes lip service is paid to engineering excellence and then scrapped immediately when bizdev remembers something they should have told you months earlier good work goes unnoticed unless it s on some shiny highly visible area which is fine except that it creates an environment where the basics aren t attended to because they re a career dead end and nobody wants to take that hit finally hiring standards have lowered drastically in the past several years so there are a lot of people who really shouldn t be working there but are now impossible to get rid of at least they help pad out the lower end of the review scale,content
i found microsoft to be a safe supportive place to work everyone knows their job and sticks to it people shouldn t take this for granted because in other places sometimes even your job description and or expectations is ambiguous the benefits are great especially free health care i always felt like my managers and peers had my best interest and my career advancement in mind right up alongside the team s success i believe that ms is a company of integrity one that support great causes and supports the employee as far as possible there is always someone to learn from or some piece of technology to learn about right there in house so learning and mentorship opportunities are both plentiful you can gain quite a bit of weight from the free drinks affordable lunches and frequent summer morale get togethers so while all of the above is good you need to take advantage of your proclub pass the only other downside i can think of and i am really struggling is that you can easily get so comfortable at microsoft that you never ever leave i have felt like this and spoken with others who have to force themselves to see other career options moves it s hard to give up microsoft s benefits and stable work environment but having a diverse resume is also very important,content

smart coworkers at amazon you re going to work with some really bright individuals everyone i work with is very intelligent and very hard working that s evident by the clock ticking down to 6 00 and seeing all your coworkers typing still at their door desks interesting work the work you do at amazon is already quite fun on the retail side it s like running your own business there s so much to do and you re never bored with the work it s neat to see how everything you do impacts your business and improves it casual work environment it s also quite nice that you can go to work in jeans and a t shirt bringing your dog to work is great also but really it s just a wait to keep you there longer before i go into the cons i m going to say that this is based upon my personal experience during my 3 positions on the retail side of the company no work life balance 60 hour work weeks are normal meetings at 5 00 happen and people regularly work past 7 00 it feels like i go to work get home work some more go to sleep and repeat on the weekends i get a bit of a break but i still am required to work as i have certain reports and other tasks that have not yet been automated to complete amazon work kills all hope i have of an outside life always on call even being on vacation doesn t matter as you ll receive high priority emails management wants answered right away holidays are no exceptions i was called once at 6 00 am on a holiday because of a promotion running at a competitor i had to match i finished all tasks associated with the promotion at about 8 00 pm i didn t have a holiday as a result but customers were able to get a good deal on the retail products i was in charge of single people preferred do not expect to see your kids or significant other regularly if you mention you have to leave early like 5 00 which is a normal 8 to 5 day to pick up your kids or go to a dinner date expect to be mocked by your boss after you re gone i m regularly late now to almost all after work events because of work that is given and required to be completed after 5 00 too much work this is great as you re never bored but it also means you ll constantly be working lunch normally doesn t happen as you re in a meeting during that time completing something for later deadline or rushing for a fire drill it s basically survival of the fittest here you will need to automate your tasks or risk drowning in a pile of endless work there are a lot of improvements needed to be made at amazon and management wants them done now high bars once you ve automated your work and reached your goals you ll be asked to surpass that the next year eventually your goals will become impossible to achieve i ve mentioned this to management and their answers are normally along the lines of i m not sure how you ll be able to improve but you need to small raises i ve been lucky that i ve achieved high ratings on my reviews and so my raises have been just above inflation even so they re laughable raises occur only on your base pay and your base pay is relatively a small portion of your compensation golden handcuffs amazon entices you with a bonus your first two years and stock every year afterwards if you leave the company before the end of the year in which you received a bonus you ll have to pay it back if you leave during one of the years in which your stock vest it s like you worked for nothing my stock is almost equal to my base pay for example this keeps you working for the company low base pay living off your base pay is also terrible as the cost of living here in seattle is rising you re income on paper will look like you make a decent amount of money but only because of your stock bonuses if you choose not to cash out of it when it vests you ll be living by meager means as most of your pay will go to rent and other expenses having a low base pay also puts you in a different bracket for loans as they don t consider your grants and bonuses reliable income frugality only the bus pass is free parking is not and parking is expensive amazon will reimburse up 160 worth of parking but at over 25 00 a day it doesn t go very far if you can get monthly parking you ll pay less but there s a long wait list on the bright side most people leave after 2 years so you may get a spot if you stay long enough there are also no employee perks that i m aware of except free coffee and tea in the kitchen performance improvement plans pip is very real at amazon a certain number of people in your department every year will be put on it essentially the weakest link will be eliminated if you don t perform better than someone else you ll be let go politics are very real and active as well consider it similar to game of thrones make sure someone owes you a favor and preferably that s someone at a higher level promotions lateral moves are common promotions are not most people rotate after 1 1 2 years getting promoted requires laterally moving to a high job level once in that level you will need to perform the job better than coworkers doing the same job at the level you re trying to get promoted to this accounts to doing a much harder job with more work at a lower wage than everyone else until you ve proven yourself you re also competing with other coworkers at your level and job for the promotion this works great for the company but makes you feel like you re way underpaid for the job you re doing turnover i m not sure the exact numbers as amazon is constantly hiring new people but it seems high i ve seen lots of people leave amazon that i ve worked with the average stay seems to be about 2 years after that people leave for better opportunities consider this place a stepping stone to the next job also expect your workload to increase each time someone leaves until they fill that position you may be moving on before that happens though as amazon has a really high bar for hiring,content

this perspective is from the online services division specifically the ad platform teams similar to many other reviews it is nice that we have beautiful offices pretty decent compensation more on this later and super smart people unlike many other divisions microsoft is not the dominant force in this particular industry so the varied stereotypes of a monopolistic microsoft or large company intent on a closed software system here do not necessarily hold true you can see that in conversations with customers they want us to do well they want us to be a strong viable competitor to the other big players in the online advertising industry this is a huge plus when it comes to the willingness of customers to work with us especially given our big name it also manifests in a strong focus and collaboration among the dedicated engineering business group and sales teams it s a pro in the sense that the advertising business needs to be an open ecosystem and that is refreshing if you ve never worked here before one other pro that i ll mention is the fact that there is incredible talent in the strategy teams there s a ton of great strategic work going on here that you can get behind and use as your north star knowing that executives are working hard to make sure we re well positioned in the industry makes the work all the more worthwhile that determination is clear throughout the organization but it s not all rosy there are certainly a lot of things to be aware of if you have never worked at microsoft when i joined i was surprised by a few things about the organization 1 it s true that promotions are hard to come by you could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons this is incredibly frustrating and had i known this earlier i would have done more then rather than to learn it after several years but i believe it takes a certain type of person you need to know how to manage upwards extremely well talk to your manager be firm about what you want and when be incredibly focused on what moves the needle and have great impact and influence on others it s easy to be distracted on other things 2 it takes a long time to get things done because it s such a large organization great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy priorities and action items there are so many people to get buy in from but if you build the relationships and understand how the system works you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects if you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out etc then i would caution you to think hard about this get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete 3 there are a lot of managers here who don t do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities it s definitely hard because a manager wants their team to perform well but they also want to contribute directly to the organization s success balancing this effectively is hard and few do it very well,content

standard big company benefits decent discounts on gadgets 30 sunday shift bonus 39 hours week be careful with the at home advisor offer they don t pay for the space electricity nor heating and you re responsible for the safety of the equipment they lack of transparency and they tell you after a week that you won t get paid if your internet or phone are down of no fault of yours and you don t get paid if the system is down as well happens rarely though if this happens 5 times you loose your job they also don t give the exact description and measures of the desk chair and work area they want until a week after you join also the only thing they reimburse is the internet and that happens with a delay of 3 months so for example you get refunded for january eventually in april and you need to chase them be aware that you ll be receiving calls 8 seconds after a call finishes which could drive you crazy you don t even have time to drink water and it rings again if you tell the manager about it you get an aggressive face asking so what now think about it you can t cope with that it s gonna be always busy like that your work is simply and ridiculously judged according to customer surveys specifically a graphic and that could make you loose your job very very easily and don t even try to argue that it s not your fault the customer had to wait long sometimes up to 30 minutes not enough advisors or apple has very high repair prices or even that the colleagues before you just messed up and you receive the survey none will listen the surveys don t get deleted so no effort is really made there which is scandalous the turn around is very very high so none is worried about firing few agents they have 3 or more training classes in one year and they hire people from abroad so they don t waist time checking anything statistic ok you stay not ok you go theres a lack of consistency for one advisor is one metric very important for the other another metric so you ll never know you just could be fired although the most important metric is showing 100 but the less important one doesn t meet the standard it could be just 4 missing that makes you loose your job i never in my working life had to tell a customer to please just consider my job and not the other factors when they evaluate the survey because that could make me loose my job i had to do it with apple you handle up to 60 calls a day and you are evaluated for an average of 35 surveys a month also don t even try to argue about that shifts are pure luck dont count there on having a work life balance also beware when they tell you the salary will increase to a specific amount after 6 months it just doesn t happen or you re told oh it depends on performance now or there will be no increase this year so you just hear and read people leaving when you decide to work from home think that theres no career progression at all not what they make you think in the interview or later so you ll be stuck doing that dull boring and often stressful calls every 8 seconds when asked about moving back to the office the answer is theres no chair for you here or you apply and we will see be careful with the interviewers they are just wolfs in lambs clothes management is incredibly careless it s very hard to keep your self motivated working for a company that doesn t care about you and your future there is a struggle to keep things positive and avoid the truth when its criticism or it gets a bit negative some advisors even get away being aggressive to others during work only for the sake to keep things positive it s a very stubborn company if they would only invest genuinely in the welfare and retention of their advisors like they invest in their design it could be a good company to work for all in all apple big name big shame you realize you did a mistake joining them when it s already too late,content

great 2 week training at the start friendly staff good facilities very facilitating pay is decent 11 an hour basic an once you go over 40 hours its 16 50 and over 50 hours is 22 euros so if you smash out a 77 hour week like i do every second week you come out quite handsomely you get your roaster 1 month in advance so you can plan out your appointments and what not no holidays can be taken from october january at all under any circumstances there is a point system in place so basically if you get 4 points you get fired you get half a point if you are ever late by 3 minutes after time so 9 03 logging into pc you are officially late you get one point for missing a day even if you notified them you had a hospital appointment or something but you called to let them know you wouldnt be in and you get 4 points for not calling and being out so basically fired to really put this in context if you cant make 4 shifts ever you are fired or if you are 3 minutes late 8 times ever you are fired or any combo of them this is slightly un realistic when you consider snow and ice in the winter i understand they are a business but thats abit ott imo and leads you to feel like you are disposable to them which tbf you are,content

you own your own development is a phrase that is repeated often at apple while at first glance the phrase may seem like a nice sounding way for management to tell you it s not their job to help you with career advancement and that s true the fact that career advancement opportunities exist at all much less good ones is something that truly sets apple retail apart from all other retail jobs not only do advancement opportunities exist but if you tell your managers you want to do something achieve something work on improving something they ll be there to support you help you achieve that goal and if you are purpose driven in your goals and let them know what they are they ll give you the resources and time to achieve them there are many reasons to work at apple this is just one of them but one of the best things that s come from my five years with the company is the massive amount of learning and development that i ve experienced in my roles from technical training and certifications to a philosophy of soft skills that make it clear why apple is an industry leader in customer service the work life balance is tough if you re young single at least without kids and don t mind having to be available on weekends from 8am 10pm and on holidays then it s fine but if you want any semblance of a normal schedule it s not going to happen here,content

i ve only worked here for a bit over a week so i can t comment on much but so far most employees and the management are all very friendly and helpful and that counts for a lot i am generally given the option to leave early if i need to and on the flip side have the option to stay for a bit longer to do additional work near the end of each shift changes things by about an hour plus or minus the environment is definitely what i would call the strongest point the work is physically demanding you are basically exerting yourself for hours on end though you do get a 30 minute unpaid lunch break and also potentially a 10 15 minute paid break if you work for more than 5 hours it s fast paced and while you can go very slowly if you are actually trying to do a good job you re basically looking at working 3 4 times harder than most minimum wage positions requiring manual labor for your effort you get perhaps 50 more pay than minimum wage though this probably varies a bit i look at this as a means to get in shape though but for others this could be a deal breaker there was no formal interview process and half of the people who show up for the first day of work there are screenings and such didn t show up for the second due to the difficult nature of the work lastly there s very little good documentation and information made available on how you re supposed to advance i m hoping to pick this up as i go but while the assumption is that long term prospects with the company probably will require me to go into management i m not focused on that starting out,content

once you get your process down you pretty much work on your own once you figure everything out it s relatively easy but occasionally challenging depending on the day and what process your in alot of the people you see complaining are the ones who couldn t cut it at first it s not easy but you eventually perfect your process honestly i make 200 300 rate some days by accident my record is 487 but i m not typical also i had a seasoned veteran take me under his wing and now another veteran from icqa is doing the same with the hopes i ll transfer see the rate everyone is complaining about is actually revised every 3 months they take the last 3 months work flow and avarage it somewhere in the middle is where they set the rate except peak because everything goes into overdrive i actually spend much if my shift remembering to slow down because i realized i was raising the rates for every one else some people have problems making rate this job isn t for everyone but most people actually have trouble with the quality aspect you are only able to make about 1 or 2 mistakes a week or you get written up 30 day 60 day 90 day 4th written is termination i got 3 in my first 5 weeks i was basically fired but the veteran helped me out and i survived the 90 day gauntlet you can t make more than 1 mistake a week or your done it s very rare someone survived the 90 days in recent memory i m the only one to do so in a few years most people tell you to just quit and apply again in 90 days if you get fired for 4th written your not elegable for re hire so i hear i mastered my process and actually am capable of such a high rate that i ve gotten 5 errors and no written because i actually could have afforded 1 more before a written because it s actually a defect per thousand scans but i don t chance it really it s about quality also i don t want to raise the rate for everyone else doesn t make for good relations with co workers but it wasn t easy to get where i m at and i put alot of effort and focus to become one of the best in my fc it feels good when they have you come to the desk and show you your actually rated 1 stower in reno but try not to be the best you might get stuck in that process there are many different processes in each department also make sure to ask them regularly to get cross trained in a different department after xmas and aug oct it gets slow and if your cross trained you can pick up extra time in another department training is a joke a sad rediculous joke inadequate is being polite basically it s a piece of paper with what i assume is the most basic requirements by law ppe your safety equipment and the no duh sherlock s of what you shouldn t do to avoid injury or death and then a binder with some basic information mostly how to operate the scanners or workstation problem is they recruit trainers every year so basically no one has much experience training a few do but mostly the person training you will give you the impression that they just started training people because they did and worst part is amazon has this rediculous philosophy that you don t necessarily need to actually know how to the job your training people to do in order to train people to do that job so a really good possibility that the person training you has never done that job and can t even answer the most basic questions about that process unless it on the papers in the binder which good chance it s not but on the bright side you don t think to ask those questions until way later because you generally understand so little about your job that you don t even know enough to ask the obvious questions because they aren t obvious due to the sheer lack of understanding the job your doing like for instance if you scan a box and then it doesn t fit in the shelf then what well you could reset the scanner and log back in and waste 5 minutes or you could run around until you find a spot and hope you didn t confuse that item with another item in your cage i mean it s a bunch of brown boxes sometimes right or you can just move the item back to your cage if you know how and pick up another item that will fit basics of stow process not one word of such things durring training oh and don t ask your manager 9 out of 10 times they don t know either they re not that kind of manager most managers couldn t do your job to save their lives much less to the standard they require my boss is cool she openly admits this and is respected for it ask your pa which is like your supervisor they ve usually done your job at some point but mostly ask your problem solver or a veteran oh and read your scanner seems simple enough but hardly anybody does and i don t mean look at it read it honestly this advice is the best i can give you because at the end of the day it s not a very hard job it s just hard forming new habits but once you do its relatively easy it just sucks how unprepared you are when they send you out there as simple as things are sometimes simple things are only obvious to those who do it everyday by the way it s standard policy to hire 2 to 3 times more people that needed because 50 are expected to wash out in the first few weeks they like to say it s because of the high standards but really it s because the training is inadequate and they don t move people to other processes that they might be better suited for granted you need to eventually learn several processes but if they put you in one process and immediately you have problems meeting standards you are barred from moving to another task some people might fare better if they start with something else and work up to a more difficult process but i guess that s what they mean by hire and develop the best that is to say hire the first 30 people who show up and let the one of them who s really good figure it out on their own that s how you know their the best because they figured out how to do the job despite you seriously their idea of retraining some one before they fire them is to walk up to them and ask so what do you think the problem is then they ask what you intend to do to fix it then they go over something that has nothing to do with the problem your having like barcode progression then they scurry off thinking they accomplished something i mean come on i am only allowed to have 2 defects per 3000 units but the learning department can have a 80 failure rate i started with 27 other people after 2 months there were 5 after 3 months 3 by 6 months just 2 and now at one year just me but then again this job isn t for everybody yet they hire anybody just about anybody it seems instead of spending a few hours training 30 people who won t survive they should focus more hours on fewer more promising prospects,disengaged

i really can t find any i cannot recommend anybody to work at apple whether as an apple home advisor or working in cork in customer service many things went wrong for me there below is the list i was confirmed that i was hired by mail then i was highly praised by the recruiter on the phone for that it really sounded like fake congrats to me i was told i would be contacted in the next 2 days i got no news for 3 weeks i kept calling and i could only reach the voice mail then when i wrote an email i was told i should contact another contact person which i did the new person in charge of my integration apologized i didn t know at that time it would not be the only problem i would have with apple then came the equipment delivery story as i wanted to take holidays before starting i wanted to know when the equipment would be delivered i always got vague answers per mail like we will send it next week without further information the problem in the company is that the recruiters except the recruitment managers calls with concealed numbers so you cannot reach them on the phone then only a couple of days before starting the job i was asked if i could work with german language instead of french as they had a big need for german speakers i refused as i started to be pissed with the lack of professionalism there when i started there even if i hadn t high expectations i could not expect that i would have such social outcasts for colleagues i know how bad it is to talk badly about colleagues i don t like that but it is good to know with whom you will potentially work if you take the job in our team one third of the team were very fat people i do not make fun of them one third are poor geeks crazy about apple and other people who just look suspicious when you see them on camera some appear with hoods or other just refuse to appear on camera etc you just have the feeling that they decided to work from home to hide from the outside world most of them made me feel quite uncomfortable sometimes we were trained by colleagues and managers based at cork office they were just like the same i had for colleagues see above people who have been living in ireland over 6 years and who still speak an awful english it is also important to mention that the job itself is completely uninteresting extremely repetitive and that you do not have any leeway everything is scripted we are quite far from the so called creativity touted by apple this is just fiction then came the payslips problem at apple you are paid monthly i was not paid for 2 months yes it is and it seems it happens sometimes there so be prepared if you go there get enough savings or you may end up on the streets the reason why i was not paid on time was because i entered the bank details too late that was the first explanation from a not nice guy from hr which refused to give his first name that i asked only for a follow up and not for complaining about him calling a second time i was informed that too late meant that i entered the bank details only 1 month before due date yes 1 month is not enough they recognized that it was not normal they apologized they told me they would investigate blablabla all this is not really serious but nothing is really taken seriously at apple it seems i was paid on emergency tax because i did not enter the pps number in the proper format i was informed about it but i could not get a fix about what the proper format is nobody could tell me even when i was still working there nobody thinks outside the box scripts scripts scripts otherwise i am still struggling to get all my money back and it takes a lot of effort calling revenue to explain them that weird case the problem with apple is that they are based in cork and not so many people want to go there so they have to go with what they can get some bad reviews disappeared since when i saw them before applying for apple at home advisor i cannot say why however many companies in ireland ask their employees to make nice reviews on glassdoor so this review only reflects my experience it may be different for you,disengaged

the best of working for amazon is the high salaries amazon is a company with a great software infrastructure outstanding i would say in term of potential growth as software engineer that is a good challenge to get a good picture of how everything works but after few months once you get used to for that your working days become repetitive day after day just sending email writing docs and reviewing other people docs mostly everyone working in amazon is very qualified and clever but in the flip side most of them lack of professional experience out of amazon that comes down to developers who does not have real experience in software development just on amazon development which is not necessarily the same as amazon provides very particular and unique way to work the concept of teams and collaboration is not prmoted by the company instead amazon promote values which derive in a environment of arrogance and compatibility which is not healthy and makes some team member very uncomfortable my personal experience was that everyone is just looking at their personal growth instead of a team success and sharing knowledge and experience was a very rare occasion in my opinion the worse of working for amazon is the level of abstraction that infrastructure brings which ends up in making developers only good as amazon developer and not a just developer as developer was very disappointing to feeling that everything i was learning was going to be useful in meanwhile i stay working for amazon,disengaged

coolness factor of apple less so after jobs left ok pay below market rates in my opinion though looks great on a resume if you can get on a team that is a cool project then you can have a lot of fun there is a lot of projects that arent really cool or fun though and you are kinda considered in a lesser position when you are on one of those stock price made me a ton of money cause i started there when it was really low i dont know how it would work out these days had my own private office i wish i had that at the places ive worked since haha marginal pay increases even with stellar performance review the general feeling that you should be lucky to work there because it is apple lots of slow processes in the teams i was involved with org changes happened a lot i witnessed a large layoff half of a dept over 60 people when the company was absolutely thriving but that product wasnt i was tossed around managers because of re orgs food wasnt free when i worked there and it wasnt that good pretty repetitive feeling of being treated as not part of the in crowd if you aren t working on a top tier project,disengaged

there is no lack of resources at your disposal but the best part about working for microsoft were the smart and passionate people that you got to work with everyday the bar is still very high there they are also doing many cool things in many different areas of technology many companies under 1 roof but as with most companies the higher up the chain you go the more you need to be prepared with managing people managers budgets as opposed to building executing and innovating the downside is the stock has gone nowhere in 10 years and there is little to no upside politics and management reviews can be taxing and fustrating they also lead to a bloated slow execution cycle that can be terribly fustrating,disengaged

apple honors and respects all of it s staff for who they are they encourage and support creativity and diversity the grow your own programs are a wonderful opportunity for staff to gain new skills and move up in the organization apple s dedication to ensuring that it s employees are paid for every minute of work related activity is amazing i recall a recent memo that reminded us all that we should be clocked in when reading our apple com email corporate bulletins on icommunicate or even changing into our uniform t shirts i can t think of any other retailer that is this concerned with equity and fairness in the way its employees are treated the downside to working at apple everyone wants you to fix their ipod but seriously there is one thing that i think really could use improvement which is providing scheduled time to study material on ilearn or the the grown your own programs i am in the grow your own creative program and i find it very difficult to find time to study the gyo material while i am scheduled to work in the store when i am on the clock i am supposed to be on the floor working with customers things are rarely slow enough to leave the floor to study in back of house for more than a few minutes we are not supposed to review study materials on our lunch break because we are not on the clock and should not be engaged in any work related activity it s a bit of a catch 22 btw when i say that we should have scheduled study time i m thinking of maybe an hour a week nothing extreme,disengaged
i joined amazon after completing my mba from a top 5 program in my opinion amazon provides the best possible environment for mid career development i have had the pleasure of seeing a relatively small business unit grow into an industry leading advertising business in the course of a few years one of the best things about working at amazon is the opportunity to work on really difficult problems alongside really smart people the company will heavily invest in any business that shows serious potential for growth and there is never a lack of ambition or mediocrity in the work environment once you have become a true amazonian other roles outside of the company seem boring and uninteresting although the phone calls from outside recruiters won t stop coming in which is a pro in case you ultimately decide to you want leave i would highly recommend this potential opportunity for any freshly minted mba before you accept the job offer make sure you are ready to put in the work required work life balance as well as project quality is heavily dependent on what team you are on so make sure to choose wisely also you will likely be writing a lot of documents because there is no powerpoint allowed so make sure you are ready to write promotions are certainly not a given but they will happen if you show a lot of potential and have good work ethic,disengaged

as many have stated the benefits and pay at microsoft are mostly without compare a healthy dose of work life balance and a solid set of benefits made this an attractive place to work for many new and mid career people recent changes to the review model is a huge step towards treating employees with the dignity and respect that they deserve cons will vary by division so my experiences may not be representative of all or most groups within the the advertising groups i e in osd or a o microsoft is victim to a very subtle passive aggressive culture that seems somewhat pervasive of a lot of companies in the seattle area so not just a ms phenomena disagreements or direct confrontation is frowned upon while back channel negotiations and positioning drive influence if you prefer a culutre that is far more direct and vocal microsoft may not be a great environment or experience for you promotions and advancement can be very slow unless you have an acceptable alpha dog personality and or othereise are a strong contributor and belong to high profile demographic groups if you don t fit these categories make sure you get a level and salary you will be happy with when you start for at least two years or more as you will very likely not be considered for promotions until your second or third review unless you stand out like a rock star smaller companies reward and promote much quicker so if you are used to or expect that you may be disappointed while microsoft makes much of its merit based promotions rewards system its really difficult to believe it this is the problem of any large company where promotion and reward decisions are made further and further up the org hierarchy so its just really difficult for all but the most signifciant or narcisitic to get noticed this means that employees who consistently deliver good work but don t generate a lot of awareness can often be overlooked the lack of transparency around level s is one of the problems imo promotions are secretive and not acknowledged in most groups which is kind of weird and doesn t lead to a lot of trust in a system if management is not willing to acknowledge who gets promoted and who does not the work you do may be exciting but there is a 12 to 18 month cycle where the project product you are working on will go from high profile to mundane or as seen recently a target for personnel reductions this leads to one of the solutions and problems at microsoft in that you are going to have to change internal jobs frequently to stay relevant e g 18 months to 2 years there is little value placed on consistent results generation microsoft wants rock stars who will generate internal enthusiasm and garner resources and rewards which leads to a sort of self fulfilling prophecy until they ultimately flame out see xbox one launch,disengaged

first of all i want to say that not all amazon positions are the same it depends what are you are assigned to also an amazon fulfillment center is a warehouse ruled by kaizen six sigma ideologies for those who know what i am talking about it will be no surprise to find that productivity and zero tolerance for defects is an everyday thing management has productivity goals to meet efficiently and at the lowest cost so be ready to work as a machine think of yourself as a piece of machinery they could not yet create to perform the same task over and over for 9 or more hours on your feet with a productivity goal to meet per hour you ll never be sent home against your will for lack of work you work 4 days a week 10 hours each day which could be an advantage for some unpaid and paid time from day 1 full benefits from day 1 climate controlled warehouse you ll see it is not ac though overtime pays time and a half tasks assigned are simple to understand 30 minute lunch break i don t want to sound like i am complaining because after all it s a job and you are paid to work but this is by far the most physically demanding and poorly remunerated job i ve ever had at the end of the day just one thing matters to meet and exceed rates management is only concerned about one thing to meet their goals well isn t it the case everywhere the difference here is that you don t get to share the benefits when something is done right management takes all the credit amazon didn t treat employees this well from the beginning but after being sued a couple times the supreme court demanded a better work environment this hopefully can give you an idea of amazon s goals finally i ll say amazon has the second highest employee turnover in the entire country there s a reason for that my suggestion is to go there only and only if your bank account is close to 0 you ll not find a career here unless you re hired as a tier 3 or higher endless workload without a chance to relax micromanagement taken to the extreme a computer averages you work speed you are forced to meet or exceed rates for 9 hours straight ex decant 1 1 50 lb box per minute you will not sit down pause or even lean at all for the 9 effective hours you are working the system measuring your rates does not take in consideration size or weight of packages which makes it unfair for the ones at the end of the line amazon will hire anyone especially during peak season close to december so sometimes your partners are not the most professional workers coming in and out could be faster but the extreme security makes it slow physically demanding mind numbing after the long shift you ll don t want to do anything for the rest of the day the warehouse is built with frugality in mind which you ll see everywhere everything get worse during peak high amounts of people for limited space and chairs parking is a problem since there are thousands of cars trying to park at the same time that s why you re given 5 minutes grace time management is absent through the whole process unless you re not meeting your rates opportunities for promotion are not something they ll give easily which makes sense for them because they need most of the people picking unpacking packing lifting etc even if you are good at any of these they ll need you on the floor more than any other place,disengaged

this review is about the extended pc or personal computers team and holds true most of consumer electronics not just personal computers pc components peripherals accessories input devices this review will also help someone in inventory management or instock manager function as they work close to vendor managers core business experience in a vendor management function you get a business experience where you are buying and selling stuff like someone who is running his own store agreed that this is not glamorous and you do just one type of transaction 100 times over it is still a business role and not an advisory consulting role experience in challenging category personal computers and consumer electronics as such is a tough category where products come in and phase out in very short cycles and are often unprofitable so you will experience high pressure given that this category has a high topline impact and often adverse bottomline impact so you can get several years of experience in a few years on the flip side expect to work at least 60 70 hours a week during off peak times and 80ish during q4 culture and leadership amazon has a culture of treating its employees poorly but that is well documented in this forum the culture of the pc team is probably the worst in amazon it is extremely political and the leadership team treats the mid lower level esp the level 6 with utter disrespect one is made to feel extremely dispensable and people are publically humiliated in meetings all blame is passed on to level 6 while credit is readily accepted by levels 7 and 8 advice get thick skinned if you want to survive here and get ready to be thrown under the bus growth level and salary once you are in expect no growth in your salary at best you will get 1 2 hike year on year the only consolation will be that the average hike is less than 1 so you are doing ok more importantly though you will not see path to becoming a level 7 there is no such thing as promoting from within in the extended pc team all the former and current level 7s and 8s have been brought in directly at that level from outside amex sears p g ge mcmaster carr etc you can forget about getting to the next level here advice negotiate really hard for the best salary and position in terms of direct reports once you are here you are stuck with what you have negotiated all promises of getting to level 7 or getting direct reports are a way to get you in once in you will be where you are if you feel that you are not fully happy with the offer just walk away do not join hoping that things will improve else you will be miserable churn people come and go like seasons people with 1 year experience are now veterans in the team with the churn comes the fact that you have to do the work of the people who have left with no additional reward or recognition or even a small acknowledgement roles are not backfilled soon because no one internally wants to join the pc team so you will be burdened with the additional tasks for a few quarters before you can get even a part of your life back tip nothing you can do to avoid this except maybe avoid the pc team all together if you join forget about work life balance as long as you are there,disengaged

amazing people established reputable brand solid pay for retail challenging for retail compared to basically any other retail apple is definitely a step ahead in terms of quality of work i worked for best buy and some other retailers low benchmark i know but was very happy with the people that worked at the store and the level of impact i felt i was giving to customers bureaucratic at times you re a number more than an individual tough growth path just like with any retail store the experience can vary greatly based on the quality of management particularly the store manager mine was merely eh and ran a successful store but i always got the feeling that we were never progressing as a team because there was almost no growth and development there were some small portions of training but nothing that really developed the talent at retail to further employees and the company as a whole unfortunately since this is apple we re talking about it s very likely that this won t change because they are doing so well,disengaged

everyone knows amazon after working there when i talk to almost any employer they are interested in me because i have amazon on my resume i had plenty of things to work on so plenty to impress employers with during interviews things tend to move fast which is refreshing to some who ve worked in an environment they found too slow things move fast because management pushes people to get work done very quickly this often comes at the cost of having free nights and sometimes weekends most managers don t have the capacity or interest in helping with their reports being overworked because they are also being overworked of course this also means the quality of what is being built isn t as high as it would be if built as a more manageable pace people are definitely driven to prove they are better smarter and more capable than their peers this often results in a lack of interest in helping each other and childish gossip management is trying to improve this through things like changing the annual review process to focus on personal individual strengths but it will take a long time to actually change the existing culture,disengaged

apple employees are very passionate about the company they work for they love apple and the products apple makes so every day was fun to work because you were around people who really loved their employer apple offers incredible benefits and amazing training so employees know what they are selling and enjoy selling it communication was great between management and employees managers truly cared about the employees as people and the employees treated each other like family the atmosphere on the floor of a store and also behind the scenes was fantastic and fun apple is leading the technology drive in so many ways and it s fun to be a big part of introducing their genius to others pay was not great and raises were small and spread far apart if you work at a small retail store opportunities for advancement are not great slow stores are not very exciting to work in unless you want to be a manager there are not great opportunities for large pay or salary that i m aware off minus going to work at corporate which was pretty much everyone s dream retail seemed like a small offshoot of corporate and a gateway for many of my fellow employees focus on sales and metrics was not very fun for workers who were more technically or creatively gifted but unfortunately the metrics drove too much of the job,highly engaged
relatively stable employment reasonable compensation for local area relatively smart people and often very high quality hands on lead level management tl dr microsoft is a boring stodgy place that s long term career suicide for a talented inspired young person satya is changing things but not remotely to the extent the press narrative claims join microsoft if you need a steady boring job so you can raise a family or if you don t have better options don t come here if you re genuinely excited about being part of the next wave of technological innovation or if you care about being at a fun cool place to work this ain t it when you see positive glassdoor reviews for working at microsoft you should ask whether the reviewer has actually worked anywhere else microsoft typically hires people right out of college who don t yet realize they re getting a bum workplace experience relative to our industry peers it s not a coincidence that almost never will you meet people voluntarily departing a top tier tech company like google apple or facebook to work for microsoft even though countless ms employees leave daily to these competitors why is that microsoft has 4 major flaws for a young person excited about tech 1 if you are young and inspired doing microsoft long term is career suicide microsoft is a fine place to go for 3 years out of college to learn a new discipline especially if you didn t get the gpa to go straight to a top tier tech company like google or uber but microsoft is a terrible place to stay for the long term unless you really just want to have kids a suburban house and just need a day job to pay for all that doing a long term stint at microsoft destroys your marketability you will have to fight in every interview to prove that you can survive in the agile autonomous resource constrained android ios environment that is the real world companies will assume the worst of you in every interview when you re ready to leave it gets degrading fast yeah you ship windows and office to a billion people big impact opportunity right well mcdonald s ships about 2 billion hamburgers each year wouldn t a job in mcdonalds headquarters also be a big impact opportunity and if your idea of innovation involves years of making incremental tweaks to the big mac recipe or wasting 3 years of your life to bring some executive s insane vision of a hybrid ice cream chicken sandwich to market sure and the financial buffer of working at a monopoly means you burn 3 5 years of your working life on a single preventable fiasco like windows 8 or vista during which your silicon valley friends just had the time of their life and got filthy rich helping create uber or airbnb instead you ll be working on ridiculous projects that only make sense to microsoft executives living in a suburban redmond bubble you will be the butt of jokes at parties with your college friends when you try to explain what you re working on wait so it s kindof like an ipad but it has worse hardware specs no software it s buggy as hell and it s more expensive than the ipad 2 you don t get to make a dent in the world at microsoft you really won t change the world not a bit you will waste months of your life trying to get organizational buy in to do what would take days or even hours at a silicon valley startup microsoft is not a company that goes out and makes things better for customers just out of employees own passion or conviction there is no love in the microsoft workplace culture it really feels like working at a fading monopoly whose primary mission is to figure out how to keep cranking out bucketloads of cash in a new reality that no longer needs it this is what makes microsoft such a boring and soulless place to work you ll find soullessness in the dull corporate posters in the hallways the bland workspaces and the uninspired cafeteria food and with the cloudy dark skies making for dark and depressing open seating workspaces microsoft s last great perk of private offices is being phased out it can sometimes feel like a real life re enactment of apple s 1984 commercial microsoft does an amazing job selling interns on the company amazing parties food concerts free hardware and lots of executive face time if you re an intern enjoy every moment of it but remember that you ll never get any of that once you work for the company all you re getting is a sales demo 3 microsoft is a traditional hierarchical company while tech companies are typically egalitarian and flat microsoft is traditional and hierarchical this hierarchical workplace manifests in big ways and in little ways in little ways it just makes for a lousy work environment in every e mail you send your job title and tenure rank junior vs midlevel vs senior appears at the bottom so people can judge your ideas by your rank just like the military it means they serve the worst food of any tech company since executives get personally catered meals and don t have to eat the dogfood quality lunches food themselves and it explains why the shuttle service that takes you around campus is a time sucking nightmare executives have special 888 shuttles that actually work and in big ways this means that if you have a great idea you re probably not going to get it into a product unless it s specifically your job or charter to do so microsoft doesn t want you for your creativity they want you for your ability to shut up and execute on other people s executives ideas in fairness there are small improvements like the new annual hackathon yes for just a few days each year your original ideas and your creativity are valued but there are other companies where your ideas and conviction are valued every single day 4 microsoft doesn t care about you your immediate manager may care about you but microsoft as a company doesn t microsoft won t even do an exit interview when you quit when you give notice that you re leaving for a competitor basically any tech company worth its salt you literally are escorted out the door your health care and paycheck is also terminated that very same day hr interview nope you ll receive a survey that you literally can t even fill out because it expires the moment your ms e mail account shuts down d oh they literally don t care why you left it sounds brutal but microsoft at its core is traditionally an unkind company until recently they even required managers to give bad reviews to roughly 20 of their teams on a forced curve stack ranking when they ended this management practice microsoft s leadership never even had the humility to acknowledge or admit that this was ever a bad idea or unjustly hurt employees working at microsoft also means you re also stuck in seattle competitors like google let you work as an engineer in almost any exciting city in the world new york munich london san francisco you name it they have an office there at microsoft well you better love redmond at least it s only a 45 minute bus trip during rush hour to seattle while companies like google lavish new toys and freebies on employees microsoft is dirt cheap with employees the only free hardware i got was a junky surface rt promised by ballmer to be free but then we had to agree in writing that it was actually the company s property and would be returned if we left and a windows phone which was only free if we signed up for a nearly 2000 contract at the employee s sole expense despite the unambiguous promise steve ballmer made at the company meeting of a free phone and true to microsoft they never explained or apologized for not actually giving employees what they promised us as an ms employee you re generally expected to just shut up and be grateful for whatever you get microsoft seeks to be a hardware maker but offers marginal discounts to employees at best you can get a better price on the internet for an xbox or surface whereas apple gives employees 500 off a new mac microsoft gives you nothing like that m,highly

too many to mention great benefits generous salaries casual office work wear great extra perks concierge proclub stay fit benefit fantastic focus on upgrading cafeterias and new buildings are amazing free sparkling water i was always incredibly content with my deal exciting releases but enjoy the exhilaration of doing your very best work alongside incredible peers and indulge in some pure obsession pride oh and access to the library the education benefits and just the internal training system is a giant perk to me and should be globally recognized by organizations that track such things kudos microsoft librarians and training division stress know this going in that you will need to put some energy in learning how to manage stress if you can t convert it to excitement or use it healthily maybe reconsider this company hires the best of the best and they expect nothing but the best in return you will make sacrifices your health might suffer if you don t buld in some exercise to burn off the cortisol i think the review process is a bit brutal i m not convinced the process is incredibly fair because the managers have to stack rank all folks in same job level and if you all do a stellar job there is a bell curve of ratings to assign it can be very deeply disappointing and de motivating if all did 5 level work there has to be a 5 0 4 5 4 0 3 5 3 0 chosen from the five i think this is just wrong perhaps they have changed it by now,highly engaged
personally the best reason for me to work at apple was that you get to be a part of something really fantastic people are changing the way they run their lives whether business personal or both and often you get to see things become easier for them by switching to a superior operating system additionally you get to meet people who share similar interests as you especially in certain fields for example this might just be that you enjoy using a mac but you also get to talk to a lot of people who use software that s mac only like those many music or film production applications this is also a really great job for those who enjoy teaching a lot of what you do there isn t as much selling as it is answering questions and solving problems that can be really fun especially if you can show them an easier way to accomplish something or fix a problem that they thought unfixable when you do sell it s not like other establishments where the pressure s on or you re dependent on commission also the products kind of sell themselves there s rarely a situation where you feel like you have to sell something you don t believe in there s something right for everyone and part of the fun is helping someone find the right fit if your management team isn t competent or trusting just like any job it can become difficult at apple there s a lot of self motivation meaning for things to work well you need to be able to take initiative however if the manager seems like he or she might be a micro manager then it doesn t go as smoothly as it might at another apple retail store another downside of working at an apple retail store is that it is a great job and a lot of people want to work there unfortunately with such popularity comes a few bad apples no pun intended who can ruin the fun for others there s been a lot of recent limitations instituted against mac specialists and it takes away from the atmosphere of trust my main recommendation to an interested mac specialist would be to check out how the other employees are doing to see if that exciting and fun atmosphere still exists,highly engaged
lots of accountability and responsibility given to the individual with lots of trust from management i was expecting the opposite before starting there so that was a wonderful surprise entry salaries are fair but from the stories i ve seen around myself if you get results you get rewarded very quickly and by a lot benefits more that fair i heard it s one of the best if not the best in the valley people in my corner of things there was very little politics and everybody was here trying to simply do their best with each other really amazing work environment they don t hire fanboys in engineering so you get a really nice variety of mindsets diversity while still at a disappointing silicon valley esque level is much better than in other silicon valley companies and you can feel that it s that way because they know that s how you get a really complementary workforce the campus itself just feels great even though a bit cramped in collective spaces like restaurants but they re working on it i minded no public stuff no public speaking no blogging no open source no nothing you re supposed to ask and then you re told no i know many many people probably among the strongest engineers i know with a lot of open source activity who quit refused an offer or wouldn t even talk with apple just for this reason i do miss apple but i don t miss that bit i enjoy every bit of public freedom now as you can see every engineer must be in sunnyvale or cupertino there s a strong anti remote culture the right to move away from the over expensive valley is only for veterans they let you be very flexible with your time you can take some days working remote as long as it doesn t go against the current projects but that doesn t solve the fact that you still have to live in an outrageously expensive corner of the us and there s no other choice on the other hand it s kinda cool to say in the morning oh i wonder if that bit of the final product could change to accommodate what i m doing and to have lunch with the person in charge of it that same day that happened to me a bunch of times i didn t mind work hard culture i didn t mind but some people could definitely hard to maintain work life balance if you re not careful sure there was no politics and fanboy ness in my part of the company but i hear it can be very different elsewhere in apple notably outside of engineering engineering knowledge transmission is badly broken nothing is documented and it s seen as a feature of innovation i never bought it very much but who am i to judge so that s still fine with me problem is in that case you would expect a solid oral explanation culture but it s the opposite too people expect you to figure things out with no oral explanation of anything i ve heard this numerous times from people everywhere in apple so this is not a local culture thing in my department and as you would expect a lot of time is wasted that way either on trying to figure something out for days that could have been explained in 30 seconds or achieving entire pieces of work that have already been done by other people before but no one told you even if you asked i eventually got around that by bugging people and asking them the same questions 10 times in 10 different ways people were a little bit annoyed but getting the knowledge made me far more efficient than other recent engineers in my department not as fun as other silicon valley companies where you find workplaces with crazy stuff and every day is weird apple decides not to follow the there s a slide in my office trend by design and i actually prefer it this way but if you want a truly full on silicon valley experience apple is much more like other companies in that regard,highly engaged

1 big problems at amazon no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve in fact they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent time and resources towards solving them in my time there pretty much every team i worked with was solving a holy grail problem in their field and actually making progress towards it there is no dearth of interesting projects teams or ideas to work on 2 structure and thinking there is a lot of document writing at amazon in case you have not heard while some people do not like that part of the job much i think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing producing the write ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business it is really a very valuable skill that amazon does a great job of developing 3 ownership amazon treats you like an owner a grown up you have a job to do and you are empowered to do it there are checks and balances of course but you truly do own your business you make the assessments take the risks justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on there are not many fall backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward not a lot of finger poitning for failures either that i saw in fact i would say that if you do not act like an owner you will not be successful at amazon you have to embrace the responsibility and run with it 4 smart people you ll hear this a lot and personally i think some of the talk is overblown but amazon does indeed have some very very smart and talented people working there i know its a cliche but i did learn a lot from most people i worked with there and again i say most not all are just genuinely nice people i would work again with these people without hesitation i think the leadership there is especially great just really smart experienced people with sharp instincts great insights and lots of ambition it was really fun working with the folks i did 1 structure and documentation what i said above about structure and documentation while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking it can get in the way of actually doing your work everybody at amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting the secret here as in any job is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly i cannot say i was always effective at it but i tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well 2 culture i think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture its tough expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding in fact it would be very rare i think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives your team makes a huge difference so hopefully you re lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates if you re looking for free food and onsite massages you certainly will be disappointed you can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade offs 3 people politics i started to see a lot of the we are the best in the world mentality start to show up i don t believe that everyone that works at amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying every company has inside politics and even though amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics there is certainly that to deal with no more than any other company that i can tell but it can get frustrating when you re working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing so there you have it overall i loved my time at amazon i was exhausted in a very good way every day but couldn t wait to go back and keep making progress i was lucky to have a great team a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle,highly engaged
what s phenomenal about the company is that they truly know how to pick a team and develop it at apple you are not hired but rather selected like a piece of a puzzle to fit in with the rest of the team apple focuses on developing you through the trials and tribulations in retail being good is simply not enough so when the opportunity provides itself to help you become the best it is always taken your peers are there to give you feedback you are there to implement it your leaders are there to do the same but guide you or lead you through the process of growth while ultimately helping you get to the next position in the store a lot of the skills i have learned here at apple has bled over into my personal life i am able to focus a lot more and block out distractions as well we know how busy it can get on the things that matter i have learned to think creatively and strategically i have learned how to communicate passionately and effectively i have learned to empathize with upset customers and turn situations around even if i am unable to turn the situation around i have learned to calm my inner self to the point where i do not lash out at customers i am more vulnerable than ever now if you are looking for a great job a job where you have another family that helps develop you while making some great money and reaping some great benefits then this job is for you this job is not for you if you are not passionate are not vulnerable do not want to learn or do not care about helping others grow this job is for the go getters the doers the people who want more the people who want to develop reach new levels bring others along on the journey leadership and learn technical skills people skills that open your mind to a whole new level of thinking i know i know with the above post a lot of people will say oh this guy must have drunk the kool aid honestly it s not even about that i do love the company i work for or else i would have never applied no company is perfect however the job is incredibly demanding and draining keep reading for me i do not work at a flagship or avenue store chances are you might not either if you re selected so a lot of times when heading to work you might feel like oh i just work in the mall nothing to see here just regular customers i can t lie i have had those thoughts sometimes but there are ways to help with that show up to work a little earlier than expected maybe 30 minutes relax for a bit get your mind wrapped within the atmosphere because truth be told the job is incredibly demanding but it s so rewarding don t be dismayed that you work in a mall you still work at apple and you are still enriching lives it s incredibly fun questions customer s will come in and ask the same questions over and over again and over and over don t get bored find new ways to creatively express what icloud is find new ways to show customer s the differences between the iphones macs or ipads let them drive don t take over give them that and you ll see that they enjoy the interaction more i used to be in this section where you recommend solutions to customers but have since moved to the genius bar as far as the genius bar you will get those customers who are mad don t snap on them just listen let them get it out empathize once you listen and stay calm they become calm never match their level you can t fight fire with fire works almost every time the times that it doesn t work well i ll leave that up to you,highly engaged
you will work with some of the most talented skilled and amazing people in the world with some fantastic products fun exciting environment great products and for a retail store best in the world that said your work life balance will be absolutely terrible managers are demanded all the time and its on you to make sure a roll out launch or initiative succeeds often times a day off is a joke with plenty of emails and phone calls for follow up or other things of the sort apple controls communications so often times you re making special trips to work to do things and due to the secretive nature of the company you re often given very little lead time to get things in place rearranged schedules are the norm pto is a pain in the ass to schedule tough to see the next move once you ve reached management the limited number of stores is also a built in challenge to that,highly engaged
i have worked for amazon in operations for nearly 7 years and while it has not always been easy it has been an overall great experience and i would strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to put in the effort amazon managers work hard and are held to high expectations which simply is not for everyone for me personally i have loved being surrounded by highly intelligent people who have a great work ethic and who care passionately about taking care of customers and contributing to the success of the organization so i actually prefer the fact that we demand a lot of managers and in doing so we end up with very high quality managers one of the best things about the company is how empowered managers are to make a difference and have an enormous impact overall it s hard to beat amazon in terms of a fun company to work for that will push you to grow and provide you with awesome opportunities anyone who can get through the tough hiring process is crazy not to take a job with amazon as long as you re willing to work and not simply looking for an easy paycheck the work life balance can be challenging at times but to some degree it can come down to how you as an individual manage yourself sprint when you have to peak but catch your breath use your paid time off when you can the only other con is that there are a large number of very weak people leaders in the company super smart but terrible with people and there are so many of them in senior positions that it is a self propagating issue since they do not understand their own shortcomings and the danger of continuing to hire promote other people like themselves that being said there has been some notable improvement in recent years and i m happy to say that i ve crossed paths with some exceptional leaders in senior positions recently,highly engaged

1 people the people at ms are amazing in how much they are willing to help out with anything and everything they are very smart and very passionate about what they do it is fun to meet them and work with them the kellogg alumni at ms are especially helpful and nice 2 networking company culture the company encourages a lot of networking and exchange of information it allows you to meet people from other groups and learn about their projects it is nice to know that the work you re doing does not stay in a vacuum and that you are able to leverage other people s knowledge and best practices so that you re not spinning your wheels 3 opportunities it is encouraged to rotate and spend 16 18 months with different groups and doing different things so it gives everyone a great opportunity to network within the company and try different things 1 team culture my team had an intense culture due to all being ex consultants and due to working on the strategy of the flagship product it was a different culture than i expected and was therefore disappointed however i did enjoy working and collaborating with them it was more of a personality and style issue so my advice would be to interview the team as they are interviewing you during the second round 2 size of the company the company felt really big and it felt like it could swallow someone who was not doing the right things e g networking constantly changing jobs every 18 months working intensely on side projects etc i felt like it added an extra step on the responsibilities that came with the job 3 seattle seattle was a fun city to be over the summer however i could not see myself living there over the long term it felt too small and much less urban than i had imagined,highly engaged

satya nadella is a truly spectacular leader as well as phil spencer i honestly loved working for both of them and knew that what i was contributing to was an inspiring vision and mission the benefits at microsoft are outstanding the events are a blast and are a fantastic motivator throughout the year the opportunities for growth and diversity in your job some of the best i ve ever seen microsoft also is in a serious growth phase so it s an exciting time to be a part of the organization i m still pretty shocked at my experience since day 1 i ll try to leave emotion out of it and share the historical events that occurred to remain truthful and not exaggerate when i first came in as an mba here i was brought into my dream finance role 24 hours after joining my manager went on paternity leave for about 8 weeks i heard from him a couple of times in that timeframe and that was about it i got started working on some onboarding projects and everything was more or less fine my office was on the other side of the building so i didn t get to sit next to my team for the first 7 months my teammates never really came by to say hi so it was tough to build new relationships with them having to walk over constantly to try to connect after my manager returned he only talked to me a handful of times i d say i sat in about 8 hours worth of 1 1 s over my whole year there i never received a performance review or feedback on a single project i never received a quarterly or year end performance review i never heard that i did well but was reassured that that wasn t my manager s style he s never really one to say good job not great management i never felt like i was wanted in that role and i heard from numerous people that i was placed in that role by a recruiter and was never actually placed in an open role and thus i wasn t really wanted from day 1 now for the part that i still am just in shock around in my organization i was the only white person about 3 different times in team meetings jokes were made about how i wouldn t understand something or couldn t relate because i was white and not asian middle eastern i just brushed it off and laughed but felt like i experienced a form of racism that i had never felt before having not felt like part of the team ever and then had them make jokes about my race at my expense it really didn t feel good but because i m caucasian and not something else if never felt like i could say anything about it because it s seattle and many people believe racism against caucasian people isn t possible i would disagree based on my experience at the end of my time after declaring i was leaving i never heard from a single hr rep i had so much i needed to share and i didn t even get an email about my departure nothing zero no form of exit interview no goodbye nothing so now i m sharing this all here because i didn t get to share it internally it was the strangest exit i ve ever had the moral is people leave managers not companies microsoft is a spectacular company but my management experience was really really poor and hr really dropped the ball here i was so sad too having come into my dream job and feeling unwanted completely from day 1 i would ve stayed if even one person showed that they cared in the least i had shared this with multiple friends there on my last day who had been there for years and they were in utter disgust and shocked that hr had never reached out they reached out on my behalf and even that didn t trigger a response i m just really shocked and sad i was really excited to build a career at microsoft and chose to leave due to this experience,highly engaged

i worked at two different stores one in new york city and one in california bay area i really enjoyed having a structure to each day and a sense of direction and goals within my role they provided excellent training and were supportive of my desire to transfer even matching my pay when i hit a rough patch in my life they provided a lot of good resources for me and were really understanding which is pretty rare and pretty great i also just had fun working there there were many days where i laughed so hard that my face hurt i made a lot of wonderful friends and it changed my life it is what you make of it and no it s not for everyone but it s a great way to get into the tech industry and can take you far it also really is the best retail job if you re looking to go that route it s really rewarding and you re always learning new things the perks benefits discounts are great work life balance was a constant and often painful struggle for me and ultimately one of the biggest reasons i decided to leave i had never worked a full time retail schedule so for me as someone with a delicate immune system and a need for routine it was a huge shock and really compromised my abilities to do my job if you ve already worked retail you ll probably do better than me that said if you ask they will be flexible for you in turn so don t be afraid to ask sometimes it would feel as if we weren t being told everything we needed to know for our jobs but it all changes so fast that i guess it s not realistic to expect that who knows it s also very different from one store to the next you will end up giving a lot of yourself to your customers and i think sometimes this is encouraged to a point that is unhealthy if you re a people pleaser you might have a tough time i also wish they had a coffee machine in the break room,highly engaged
microsoft has great benefits we haven t paid a nickel in medical out of our own pocket in 10 years reasonable 401k matching i earn an excellent salary when all benefits salary and stock are taken into account i have had occasional opportunities to do excellent work but mostly my work is somewhat pedestrian and straightforward you can make a difference here but it s frequently hard to force a significant change in direction even when you know it s right you work around extremely intelligent and motivated people even the hobbies people pursue are done with excellence this is truly amazing ms has put a real premium on my personal growth working in such a large intertwined environment has forced me to grow up in a variety of ways and this has improved me both personally and professionally and the company spends precious time each year helping me focus on this sometimes the training seems lame but it always forces you to think about how to improve yourself this might be my favorite result of working here no customer contact if you re a developer ms is just too big development at ms is much more time based than quality based it s unfortunate but that s probably the way i would do things if i were in charge anyway as it makes good business sense but it s frequently not very exciting ms doesn t seem to be a place you retire from there is constant pressure to improve or leave and let s face it we all have our limitations we can t all be ceo so you re eventually likely to be forced out in one way or another as you get older and get close to your potential so while the constant improvement is great for you it s only great to a point and then you start to have trouble changing jobs within the company as your reviews level out,highly engaged
most of the days i spent working at the fulfillment center were either very fun or felt very rewarding at the end of the night it was usually pretty motivating and management did make a consistent effort to make the environment fun ny and exciting in a way it was like getting paid to have a gym membership also the physical conditions are excellent compared to other warehouses very comfortable even though hot at times unless you stay hydrated my location was very willing to train employees on other areas and most of the time i wasn t doing the same thing each week i enjoyed coming into work most of the time trainers feedback is meant to help you and isn t accusatory there were also coaches in your similar position stower packer counter that would help you along the way at the stand up meetings most of the time you were aware of how you were functioning as an individual and as part of your team always fun competitions for gift cards and so on based on productivity career advancement tuition reimbursement is possible even if not directly related to amazon for healthcare such as phlebotomy and others this is excellent for college students paying bills along the way to further themselves through amazon or elsewhere i switched my shift pattern to adjust my schedule for schooling but wasn t told anywhere that i had to remain on the accepted shift for more than 90 days before being able to transfer to other shifts i wouldn t have done so if i knew this or signed something but i would go back at any time productivity and quality rates at times can be unrealistic if there is an inconsistent work flow but this depends on department and no one is held accountable or reprimanded if its understood that these factors are outside of our control mandatory overtime is somewhat common but should be expected when you sign up i never minded it but can be troublesome if someone is looking for a work life balance probably won t happen at really any warehouse during holiday season,highly engaged
after working as a college intern at the company i was offered a full time position which i accepted as a first time job out of college i can t recommend it enough just make sure you re on a team working on an unreleased product an amazon team in heads down development mode is an amazingly productive and inventive thing projects are rapidly prototyped torn down and built anew the build system is bar none the best i have ever used if you need some library to do something you just depend on it done we had a senior principal engineer acting as a sort of roaming quarterback among our teams and he frequently sat in on design brainstorming sessions he also sat ten feet away from me so bouncing ideas off of him was frictionless and really helped me grow as a fault tolerant systems architect people wear many hats at amazon and you can quickly make a name for yourself as the x guy if you devote yourself to being an expert in x plans change and you can get a golden opportunity in your lap if you re lucky for me it was defending our system architecture against three senior principals get your name out there and you ll have other potentially cooler teams trying to headhunt you from your current one i would recommend this strategy stay on a project long enough to make a name for yourself in some way and then jump ship to another team a year and a half to two years is a good periodicity for this process the best thing about amazon is that if you find yourself getting tired of the same old drag in your current position you can jump ship to another team and work on something entirely new and exciting this is not microsoft there is little animosity between teams and no hard feelings will be had you can be writing servers in java one year virtualization modifications to the linux kernel the next and messaging systems in erlang the next corporate culture is good there aren t as many hokey ice breaker or get to know each other events as in other companies i once heard the company described as having a good drinking culture which certainly was true within my team our outings were more like pub crawls with pool and bowling often thrown in as an afterthought as we wandered around capitol hill good times were had the pay is pretty good too and i hear the stock ain t doing half bad too in summary i wholeheartedly endorse amazon as a first out of college job for people who want to learn a lot about anything just don t dig down too much in one team and you can rise to prominence in any area you want within a year i was designing and implementing key pieces of our architecture and my ideas and proposals were taken as seriously as those from people with a decade or more with the company n b my team probably ranked in the top five for pager pain metrics i ve seen the histograms and there is a long tail you ll likely find yourself in a team with far less pager pain but be warned that it can be bad yes you have to carry a pager yes it can be hell you will invariably try to go to a pub one hour before your rotation ends only to be paged into an event that requires a conference call with multiple vps and on edge datacenter engineers you may go to bed at 1 am sunday night be paged at 5 am monday morning and not stop firefighting until 2 am tuesday it can be draining people say amazon never ships a version two of anything and i think this is the reason why asking your educated thought workers to sit around doing menial keep the stack running tasks can be a pain and the small team sizes are great and all but you ll find yourself wishing for more people to share the pager pain misery loves company at one point my project entered a dark phase in which all feature development tasks were superseded by the need to just keep the service up and running hacks and kludges were put in place to reduce the load and extreme measures were taken to keep us up and running in retrospect our project was characteristically different from other web services and this sort of thing was predictable but we didn t get ahead of the problem quickly enough one tends to blame management when these things happen saying we ll take the technical debt and put it on the backlog for now one too many times can result in one hell of a lot of interest to pay off the whole period seemed like hell when it was happening a team member switched teams the intern went back to college the managers did a nice little switcharoo we had three developers to actually code but it passed and i got an offer with another team with essentially no oncall rotation and whose work i really admired i didn t take it because i knew i d soon leave the company due to a cross country move i didn t want to join a brand new team for only two months but the thought crossed my mind so if you have a needy family enjoy sleeping or can t bear the thought of a pager maybe amazon is not for you if you re willing to look past that in order to work at a company that actually ships products rather than having them always in beta or research i say the pain outweighs the gain,highly engaged
pay benefits working at home apple swag the pay is awesome along with the benefits too they offer the best insurance at great rates that i ve ever seen i work from home and absolutely love that aspect of it apple swag are the perks of the job receiving shipments of apple branded mugs hoodies blankets etc contests continuously to get you more swag my co workers are great very helpful and caring the lack of support from management is heartbreaking really apple has so much to offer but then when thrown to the wolves management is mia the attendance policy isn t up to par with industry standards either a reason and an approval must be received from team management to even use earned vacation or sick time i don t feel that a reason should be given to take any earned time off if the time off is available on the calendar i received a promotion and that s when the lack of care began i am the highest level with no help except from my peers in the event of a difficult situation management wasn t available to assist with decision making issues etc this position is extremely stressful for me as is most of my peers this position is what drives excellent employees to seek out other employment,highly engaged
i love working for microsoft it s the best job i ve had i m a high performer and have been well compensated for it i ve owned my own company and have held leadership positions in a variety of different types of orgs and can truly say that on balance it s awesome smart talented people fantastic benefits great to have stock grants versus options particularly given the market good work life balance especially if you have a family high degree of freedom to define your role and manage your own business as a field employee versus corporate if you understand how big organizations work and know how to navigate them you ll do well here where people fall down is assuming they can change the organization without really understanding how it works first the organization is byzantine it takes easily 6 months to begin to understand the basic breakdown between the different groups it s also hard to find any one spot where you can understand how all the pieces fit together this can be extremely frustrating initially and also makes it difficult to find the people you need to in order to accomplish your goal corporate is sometimes slow to respond to either the concerns of the field or of the customer incentives between parts of the organization are sometimes not well aligned we also tend to be a little too focused on our internal organization versus the needs of the customer,highly engaged

thanks for setting up this site glassdoor google is an industry leader in many endeavors and often finds itself listened to by competitors and partners alike i hope that does not come off as overly confident it s a wonderful place to work our management and product teams are thoughtful about all of our projects google enjoys a solid reputation among consumers something that is difficult to achieve and we lead the internet industry in consumer satisfaction it makes me proud to say i work for a company that is so highly regarded by our partners competitors and the general public we are a company that provides innovative answers to today and tomorrow s questions our technology is more powerful than our competition and we continue to add new services to our already robust product suite we leave the end users satisfied and our partners happy that we re looking out for their best interests there are other great reasons to work for google yes there is free lunch but that is just one piece to the puzzle it s generally the overall trust that the company has in it s employees and the respect that the employees show for the company management has decided not to put a cap on sick days and trusts that employees want to come to work which we do we want to work on the products that will change the way that people access and consume information we want to speak to clients collaborate with them and work with them to change the world that s the attitude i have going into work every day for the last three years and that s a really good feeling the best part is google is enabling this attitude as google has grown larger over the last few years it has hired tremendous managers adding new layers to our corporate hierarchy the company has hired the best of breed from many industries allowing google to take advantage of the extensive networks created by those individuals these individuals are fantastic team players industry visionaries thought leaders truly an amazing set up people with whom to surround yourself that is how i would describe the average google employee and what they bring to the table not necessarily a downside the level of mutual respect and admiration is very high here we are all cooperative or should i say cooperatively competitive as we believe it brings out the best in us and pushes us to succeed with levels of achievement levels so high it is difficult to see people who do succeed but who are not the michael phelps of their respective field,highly engaged

i started working at the apple store part time when i was still a college student i loved the fast paced environment and that every day was different it was great to know that every day i would learn something new plus i loved working with people i truly felt like part of a team also there was tons of opportunity to specialize in different areas within the store towards the end of my time working there management began to focus a lot more on professional development which was awesome i did not enjoy working retail hours because it was difficult to keep a normal routine i also felt management was less than supportive of my growth within the company despite my impeccable sales record the managers at this location tend to play favorites with the people that they like best not the people who have worked the hardest or been with the company the longest i did not feel like management was open to new ideas unless they came from corporate,highly engaged
pay is quite high be mindful though and do the math most compensation is tied to tenure from signing bonuses for rsus restricted stock units as well as yearly increases all are tied to a vesting schedule that is up to 4 years long on most occasions we do this for two reasons 1 retention is horrifically low at fulfillment centers so anything to incentivize tenure we re not above bribery 2 the vast majority of amazon managers have very short tenures at amazon so few make it through to the end of their vesting schedule and they therefor never realize their full compensation so it s easy to offer a high rate of pay when one knows most managers will never realize their full compensation the ego boost for working for such a respected brand is enticing amazon is fully aware of this and will leverage it as needed promotional opportunities exist if you are willing to relocate you will work with some really bright folks who are driven and motivated be aware of what you see online linkedin facebook web career site etc about community involvement volunteerism corprate team building exercises and the look at how much fun we are having and how amazing it is to work here vibe is are 100 corporate ativities they do not exist in the field in any capacity whatsoever it s simply marketing to entice candidates amazon is a 24 7 365 business so expect to work overnights as well yes the recruiter will deftly avoid answering schedule questions yes even if you are lucky enough to initially get a coveted day shift yes regardless of your kids husband wife s schedule reality is people transfer resign or get promoted all at breakneck speed at amazon which means in very short order there will be a vacancy on overnight that needs to be filled you can protest but it won t do much good communication is sorely lacking communication to help shape a common purpose or best practices or really anything is almost non existent in the amazon fresh business it doesn t exist in the business as a whole nor in any building i ve worked in zero work life balance i ve heard rumors that jeff bezos himself said he hates that term the culture reflects that within a fulfillment center you will never work less than a 12hr day my experience is that 14hr 16hr days for myself and my peers is the expectation and the norm that is 5 days a week and you can expect your boss to call email text you on your days off by the way this is in no way tied to a peek season schedule this has been the norm my whole time at amazon whether it s december or june keep in mind that you will be on your feet almost the entire 12 16hr shift there are no offices nor almost any tables or chairs in amazon fresh buildings kind of a funny aside people at amazon due to work schedule and stress i believe all look older than they are there are plenty of red sunken eyes heavy heads premature wrinkles really just general body language that screams i m tired one of amazon s leadership principles is frugality generally a good principal to live by i believe it is a negative though as it pertains to associate incentives moral and recognition at amazon fresh no matter how hard folks work on completing some genuinely difficult projects or tasks there is a miniscule budget to run contests or recognize outstanding contribution you would hope that someone in seattle would acknowledge that an occasional pizza party won t impact profitability terribly and can just be a genuinely thoughtful gesture that would be appreciated but alas that is not the case i could go on about a number of other con s but in short amazon treats its employees from associates to level 7 managers as commodities to be exploited chances are excellent this work will cause you and your family significant stress due to extremely long hours and time away from home even during your limited time away from work you will be so tired and fried that you will be a mere shell of your former self if you are prepared to basically give up a personal life family vacation working out really everything not amazon related and pick up an oar on a 1st century ship crossing the ocean than amazon is for you after all the money is good you might be that one in a hundred who has a fulfilling career in an fc but chances are excellent you will dislike the job and if you can afford to you will leave as so many before you have good luck you beautiful unique amazing snowflake if you decide to join,highly engaged

pros in the words of dan pink motivation the things that make us happy in work are not just focused around money pay people well enough to take money of the list of concerns and what motivates staff autonomy mastery and purpose i worked at amazon web services for 2 years as a solutions architect and i can say hand on heart it was the best job working for the best company ever let me explain in a little more detail as to why this is fact autonomy no micro management from the team leaders bosses peers but a wealth of support in all aspects from career aspirations to soft skills and everything in between it s day one right sure was for me ideas welcomed and occasionally i thought of something that someone else had not thought off this was a rare thing none of that malaise that creeps in and stifles growth personal and company to the point that you can t wait till the end of the month and dread getting up in the morning you are not spoon fed anything go out and seize the day to make you and amazon better each time you are responsible for carving out your own destiny yes this puts more work on you but is there really any other way mastery such a wealth of training support mentoring career planning was offered to me it was a real inclusive feeling what would you like to do long term was a question asked of me by my sa manager at the time we had a one hour conversation on what do i really want how he would be able to support these objectives if you have ever done the five x why s you will understand just how difficult a question this line of questioning is suffice to say the manager really got me thinking and helped me plan out the next few years of my career thanks pf there was plenty of self paced training available as well as instructor lead training to ensure that i was always at the top of my game great opportunities to apply this knowledge to customer questions and peers purpose the most customer centric company on the planet is a high accolade to achieve and maintain with the leadership principles lp in place you know what is expected from you before you even start from a cultural point of view i knew what was expected from me and when i was failing the support was there from my line manager who is one of the best people that has managed this employee in buckets regularly taking time out to ensure that things were going well from both perspectives my role was clear and a real sense of purpose to go out and achieve but how i delivered was not prescriptive see autonomy overall working and aws is not easy with the wealth of information that you need to absorb to the number of customers clambering for guidance you will always be busy but this is a good thing if you are looking to kick back and do enough to get by don t apply to work here you will not enjoy it if you don t agree with the lp s again don t apply on the other hand if you delight in being challenged being given the opportunity to shine and delivering look no further and get to amazon jobs to find that role that you know you could smash i have read a few reviews about wlb work life balance and i can honestly say that whilst there is pressure to work work work you need to have the backbone and disagree lp when the balance in not quite right i did just this very thing and support was given instantly to address this area this is not a just local line manager taking pity but a directive from the very top to ensure that we strike the right balance we are all individuals and have different needs at different times it is not easy to get this right all the time but when it was going in the wrong direction for me a conversation was all it took to get the results i needed to support me and my family and the wlb was restored no dramas no fuss happy employer and employee there are so many other elements to the role that are not understood from the outside looking in so here are a few of the things that just add more value to me that make me a better person and therefore a better employee events supporting events like summits partner workshops team meetings are great as you get to meet a lot of different people and improve your understanding of what aws customers and peers are talking thinking about the ability to flex your technical and soft skills and know that you are giving your customers a great experience is so rewarding that you look forward to the next one as soon as it finishes despite being exhausted thinking is hard interviews you are interviewing your peers you have a big say in who will be joining your team this was fantastic for me as we have all worked in places where new comers are simply thrust upon you to deal with being an integral part of the hiring team was a great revelation both in terms of the empowerment but the insights that interviewing gives you interviews becomes a cycle of improving your interviews improving yourself to conduct better interviews improving yourself to ensure that you live up to the standards you are expecting from candidates tech wow i could write pages on this element but suffice to say that the pace is relentless there is no way that you could not fail to be impressed with the sheer pace of innovation you are actively encouraged to add to this innovation and we are even given time to take a break from our busy schedules for the sole purpose of coming up with the next great innovation the hard part is keeping up and for a geek like me challenge accepted i have had to really thing about this element as i enjoyed this role so much i don t have anything negative to say the only area i though was top heavy was the administration side of being an sa there are tools in place to support you but not joined up in such a way that makes dealing with expenses hotels travel

on my first day at facebook i remember asking myself is this company for real how am i here how does this company exist facebook is the epitome of the perfect company a wise man once told me about the four ps of the perfect employment product problem people profit is the product interesting this product serves over 1 5 billion people it is the most exciting product to be part of is the problem interesting beyond interesting we re trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication through sharing through education etc in any area of the company the problems are all great problems to solve what about the people the people are literally the best people i ve ever worked with in any position i ve been through they are brilliant kind friendly and completely supportive i left my last company as a senior member and at facebook i still feel like i m learning something new from my colleagues every single day beyond my colleagues the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual s career growth to help us grow deep within our roles support groups to help you become a better manager classes to help individuals transition from one career to another i ve seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths e g designer to engineer researcher to designer designer to pm etc you pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be so what about profit facebook luckily is doing very well in this area at a personal level facebook pays also very well i was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to facebook a no brainer take a great product great people amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow that is what facebook is and i hope it never changes i love this place the only con i ve found is that facebook s campus is a bit in the middle of no where but honestly with the flexible shuttle system and an all day shuttle that goes back and forth between downtown palo alto it s not so bad,highly engaged
if you happen to be deemed a rock star for any particular year the bonus compensation will be very nice indeed benefits are definitley nice if you have a family everybody in the world has heard of microsoft which can work for you and against you as well company events are usually pretty good i particularly enjoyed techready every year great place to learn about other microsoft products that you may not have any prior experience with lots of internal resources to leverage when you want to explore something new lots of smart co workers as long as you re not management you can almost guarantee that your peers won t be idiots extremely likely that the quality of your work will have exactly zero impact on how you are perceived and rewarded by management it s really just a popularity contest and there aren t any checks and balances on this process you could be the smartest guy on the planet delivering the most amazing solutions generating nothing but love from your customers but if you didn t happen to work with your practice manager at his previous company or don t golf with him etc you can probably forget about recognition seriously this isn t sour grapes here i was actually pretty well rewarded but the vast majority of smart hard working people are ignored at best and taken advantage of at worst,highly engaged
pay benefits working at home apple swag the pay is awesome along with the benefits too they offer the best insurance at great rates that i ve ever seen i work from home and absolutely love that aspect of it apple swag are the perks of the job receiving shipments of apple branded mugs hoodies blankets etc contests continuously to get you more swag my co workers are great very helpful and caring the lack of support from management is heartbreaking really apple has so much to offer but then when thrown to the wolves management is mia the attendance policy isn t up to par with industry standards either a reason and an approval must be received from team management to even use earned vacation or sick time i don t feel that a reason should be given to take any earned time off if the time off is available on the calendar i received a promotion and that s when the lack of care began i am the highest level with no help except from my peers in the event of a difficult situation management wasn t available to assist with decision making issues etc this position is extremely stressful for me as is most of my peers this position is what drives excellent employees to seek out other employment,highly engaged
when they say that netflix chooses stunning colleagues they are not kidding i am constantly impressed with the smart thoughtful people i work with on a daily basis i love the company s focus on inclusion diversity and i honestly notice it often by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting and i am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles the transparency is usually great and it s fun to be a part of an exciting growing company the salary is exceptional and the benefits are also excellent note hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits but it s still great there s a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to e g my kid has a doctor s appointment i will be wfh etc as well as to make decisions that benefit the company your team etc the culture deck is intimidating when you first read it but i have found that it s pretty right on there are some things that i think are not adhered to quite as often as it says but overall it s on point work life balance is a thing but i do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries i work a couple of hours of ot a week and i am generally on call in the sense that i will check my email after hours but i am not expected to work at off hours in fact my manager specifically tells me to wait until i am back at work to complete things i do think upper management works very long hours and that can lead to burn out the flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation personal time and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor s appointments stuff for your kids wfh etc the firing culture doesn t seem to touch ics as much as it does management it is scary sometimes to see those messages come through but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments questions concerns etc i do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things you have to be smart about choosing the right time people the onboarding training needs a lot of work not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating i spent the first few months wondering if i had made the right choice by coming here but i am a year in and feeling much more comfortable they say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning and 6 months to feel like you understand everything that feels pretty accurate to me,highly engaged
the soul of apple and it s strong point is the people everyone you work with is proud and excited to be there everyone believes in the product s and are extremely knowledgeable about everything apple this was the first place i worked where everyone got along where i made close friends with and felt proud to be a part of working at the apple store isn t because you want to make money it s because you want to spread the word about the product because its changed your life and you want to help others do the same i love it when a first time mac user comes in and realizes that there is something other than the mainstream pc that will not only work for them but that they ll have fun with i can t count the times when a customer makes the switch from pc to mac or even zune to ipod and they come back just to say hi or to tell us how great it s working for them apple employees are not regular retail workers we are the rock stars of the retail world when a customer comes in and asks where something is we don t just point a finger in the opposite direction we personally help out customers according to their needs and find them the best solution it s a common thing to be on a first name basis with regular customers i love welcoming people back to the store they re surprised you remembered them from the one time you helped them out and that you even remember their name and situation working with people at the apple store is on a personal level and that is what makes our customer service excellent the only time i felt there was a downside to working at apple was when it came for a promotion granted working at apple means growth and moving up however i felt that there were several times that there was favoritism going on as far as promotions there have been a couple of instances were those being promoted were very close with management and many felt that the promotion was more deserved to another employee who worked longer or harder another similar situation that has happened before would be when an employee is promised a certain promotion or is next in line for an opening position and then it is given to someone else,highly engaged

even though google is huge even newbies can have impact i ve loved how easy it is to speak up and change things when something isn t working right it s also energizing to be working with so many smart motivated passionate people plus the pay and benefits are excellent google and i expect many other companies in the industry invest a lot in their employees and also expect their employees to invest a huge amount of their energy into google for someone who is super motivated by career this is great if you have many other areas of your life that need to take precedence it can also be very draining and unsustainable over time google is a great place for superstars but if you are merely really good at your job and then want to go home at the end of the day and think about other things it can be hard to feel like you re keeping up,highly engaged
microsoft is an amazing place to learn from others and if circumstances allow it grow professionally within the company the company has above average health benefits excellent continuing education and self study resources excellent self service mentorship program overall compensation is above average when you add all the fringe benefits and services an employee obtains since day 1 working in microsoft many of the following observations are rising trends that in my opinion started after bill gates departure in 2006 and now increasing at a much higher pace ever since the company entered in a never ending reorganization reshuffling loop at the end of that same year middle management in some groups more than others do not observe microsoft s code of conduct they appear to exemplify the phrase the end justifies the means honest hard work may go unnoticed if you are not politically connected to the right people managers are empowered to decide upon their direct report s fate within the company having almost uncontested authority to promote or fire anyone reporting to them moreover the system lacks of appropriate check and balances to effectively apprehend potential managerial misconduct therefore the key to succeed and grow within the company is instead of looking for a new role within the company you should always be scouting for good managers that could potentially hire you into their team in other words having a good manager matters more than landing upon your dream job on several occasions over a period of 6 plus years i ve seen how hr sides with management instead of objectively assess what could be at stake in any given situation or complaint employee morale and passion keeps declining the majority adopts a see no evil hear no evil attitude in order to survive or spare retaliation from management it was of great disappointment not only to witness highly unethical behavior coming from middle management but to see how upper management looked the other way although microsoft is still a great company to work for and to list in a resume i would recommend that if looking for a new workplace to look at other great companies that will probably enrich more anyone s professional career if you are already working for microsoft then take pride in what you do while understanding that the company is going through a challenging phase and always keep in mind that the best thing to do is to do the right thing,highly engaged
i really liked working with smart creative and motivated engineers i felt like the first level engineers all worked together very well and got a tremendous amount of work done in an incredibly short time i m missing working with them it will be a good career memory pay and benefits are excellent i also enjoy the whole orlando area now the problem management is the worst everything i was enjoying about working at the orlando site was ruined by these corrupt politicians first of all being a manager at apple makes them feel as if they are the best on the planet this translates into extreme arrogance and failure to listen to anything any engineer says they are not good managers they just think so and demand to be treated like they are great forget about anyone listening to your ideas and expect to be talked down to all the time next and i think worst there is such a strong desire by management to retain their jobs and hopefully advance their careers at a company name like apple that they will do anything to make themselves look even greater than they act like they are so you will always fail to get a manager to listen to your explanation that an idea is bad then some story will be created to blame you when that bad idea actually goes bad because managers cannot be held accountable for their mistakes this was a very corrosive work environment i realized that instead of a chance to make a real difference my career would only be one of being ignored worked to death and blamed for every bad move a manager made i was paid well but not well enough to put up with such undeserved abuse i voluntarily resigned when i had enough,highly engaged
i worked as an fte here for five years people are smart it s a fun environment salaries are good and there s a lot of variety in the work health benefits used to be great but now they re pretty much on par with other companies i left the company for the reasons stated below but now i work at microsoft as a vendor there s a ton of work available for vendors contractors at microsoft most teams want to hire contractors with prior microsoft experience so if you re a former fte you ve got it made if you accept a vendor position with one team and hate it you can end your contract and just search for a new contract on another team and the best part is as a vendor contractor you don t have to deal with the horrible performance review system and you don t have to deal with stupid visibility projects you can just do your work and get paid for it and not have to deal with the internal politics it s a sweet deal you ll notice that more and more of the contractors vendors at microsoft are former ftes and now you know why company has gone downhill since i first started working there the biggest problem is the performance review system they ve revamped it several times but they still use a stack ranking system and award scores based on a curve this is horribly demoralizing to make matters worse your manager can award you a certain score but managers above him or her can lower your score in order to get their org to fit the curve so if your manager gives you a 2 for example a higher up manager can lower it to a 3 because the org already has too many 2 s how screwed up is that i finally left when this happened to me i worked my butt off got a great review but then the gm bumped my score down because i wasn t visible enough the guy didn t even know me god forbid he actually listen to my manager who knows my work and read my review how are we supposed to stay motivated knowing that at review time some random manager can change our score at will over the years i found that employees in general are more concerned with trying to make themselves visible to management so they ll get a good review than they are with trying to put out a good product for our customers the focus is all me me me when the focus should instead be on our customers i worked as both an individual contributor and as a manager during my time here i found that microsoft doesn t value good people management skills they want their managers to be pms they want managers who will keep projects on track and lead a multitude of special projects the actual people management part of it takes a backseat i loved being a manager outside of microsoft but being a manager inside of microsoft is a thankless job you don t get paid any more for managing and it s twice the stress that s why so many managers decide to go back to being an individual contributor the other big problem is that people switch teams all the time teams are constantly losing their knowledge base it s really bad when pms leave and then new pms come onboard and have to ramp up or they decide they want to redesign how something is done in the middle of a project oh and re orgs happen all the time that screws up everything including project schedules no one knows who s responsible for what and all the worker bees twiddle their thumbs waiting for management to figure out what the heck is going on,highly engaged

the people without a doubt work life balance is usually great the meals and generally how they realise that a fun environment is inspiring i learned amazing things that i believe are unique to google i love the everyone is an owner culture which drives ppl to be responsible and motivates employees to do over perform managers can make or break ones career at google you can t get ahead without senior sponsorship and if your manager is terrible there is really not much you can do it s also a very biased place and a place where one can experience discrimination perhaps very specific to the office and team i was in finally although you would think the opposite job security is low as they are big fans of reorgs which can often leave you without a position for a while or in need of finding a new one internally there is very limited hr support in these instances i returned from maternity leave and with my new manager who had severe issues with women and maternity i suffered badly and decided to leave,highly engaged

the total compensation package is generous with opportunities for earning more through good hard work the caliber of colleagues is very high sometimes daunting even the company is very transparent you can get a good look at what is going on with nearly any project and senior management frequently communicate about the direction and goals for the company there are an amazing number of really interesting projects to get involved with and lots of opportunities for education and professional development google has big values big goals and works to solve big problems it is an exciting and rewarding place to be google isn t for everyone google isn t just a big company it is or very recently was the fastest growing company in history that growth has created some strain some things haven t grown to match a lot of the finely tuned machinery effective and appropriate management consistent methods best practices that keep large modern companies running smoothly haven t had time to develop because of this there is a great deal of variation across google some areas are very much like the near mythical stories weaved by the likes of fast company and others are more stagnant this is also mirrored in google s products some get a lot of love and others are left to dry up from disinterest it is possible to do well and be happy at google but you a have to take the initiative to make that happen and totally own it and b recognize that google is a big company with lots of people there will be friction politics and things that drive you crazy,highly engaged

best benefits around make this an amazing place to work passionate and smart co workers great focus on community and giving competitive culture as a result of review system that stack ranks employees against each other this alone is the most disheartening aspect of working at microsoft as excellent performers can get average rankings since they are compared to other excellent peers it also causes a lot of politics in the name of visibility too much focus on internal politics and measures lead to an incredible amount of time spent on internal meetings and focus,highly engaged
exciting and always changing environment best part about the job is the people you work with amazing team benefits are through the roof for a retail position especially for those of us who love technology management are good people they care about their jobs and they care about their employees frequent surveys that change the work place in impactful ways very busy in the store almost all the time break room is a great place but too far of a walk drive in a 15 minute break it takes 8 minutes to walk to and from the break room,highly engaged
i worked at the fifth avenue apple store for a year along with some other apple stores before leaving the company it was a great ride the people of fifth avenue are amazing the managers are caring and genuine and the pay was great the benefits were excellent and they invest a lot of time into your personal growth and education there are always opportunities to grow within the company i grew into different roles consistently and so did my colleagues many becoming leaders and trainers it s a very laid back environment no one micromanages you and they trust that you ll get your tasks done there s no quota or commission so there s no pressure to sell or do better it s very much about giving the customer a wonderful experience at every store i worked at there was always food provided on a consistent basis and on holidays there s always a huge hot food spread along with device giveaways they always work with your schedule and give you the time off you need this was by far the best job i d ever had so far at the fifth ave store the hours are difficult and can become stressful if you re not up for intense customer traffic fast paced environments and long hours at times there are inconsistencies amongst management regarding how we should handle situations,highly engaged
amazon is a well known and well liked company they actually do care about customers and take customer trust and experience very seriously different groups and teams are reasonably decoupled allowing a lot more independence if you re the sort of person that likes to work on lots of different bits of software and constantly jump from fire to fire it s definitely a better fit than someone who prefers quality amazon also copes very well with the high level of turn over by making sure that exposing a lot of people to a lot of things to keep employees fungible amazon makes no absolutely effort to attract high quality people in fact they do quite the opposite with their self claimed frugal absolutely under no circumstances any benefits policies when amazon tells you about work hard what they mean is that they make work hard like all the stuff you re expecting a powerful developer machine or a second monitor are things amazon has a policy against although as they will tell you you re allowed to buy and bring in your own stuff like ram ssds and extra monitors lucky you and what about admin access on your developer laptop lol no that would make life easy to be approved for that you need to be literally 4 levels up from the bottom root access on your desktop nah but they ll give you sudo but you can t actually use your desktop for development you ll have to work through a vm and to make sure you don t enjoy it your development vm will be some ancient red hat image with absolutely nothing newer than 5 years old literally just in case you ever want to google something all the libraries function features made in the last half decade won t work the internal systems at amazon are so painful that i suspect that a large percentage of employees after a hard days work come home and put needles in their arms for fun when stuff works its slow and largely unusable and a dozen times worse than any freeware you ll find on the internet the source control build systems and all other developer tools seem like it was developed by a retarded monkey after he drank too much that night apparently they re now working on an internal github that works on more scs than just git and has an awesome advanced security model i wonder why they don t try get their page load times under 10 seconds first even things that you thought were solved 20 years ago amazon manages to break with their own special flavor of retardedness like the mailing lists it s an accepted fact that it s impossible to reliably filter a message to a folder because the send is not from the mailing list there is no mailing list header and no required subject prefix another great joy is after sending a message to a mailing list your inbox will lag for literally the next 5 minutes as you get spammed by out of office replies but no one excepts the amazon workplace to be functional or enjoyable so this is just the normal and of course then there s the bureaucracy at first you ll try fight it and try do what s best for the company but soon you ll realize like half the company is nothing but paper pushers and you can easily waste a month just trying to get approval for some trivial thing in the end you ll be a lot happier here if you treat it as a job don t try fight it don t try enjoy it put in your hours and leave at the end of the day hoping your pager doesn t wake you up in the middle of the night over some stupid issue,highly engaged
freedom and responsibility you re treated like an adult you re part of a pro team that is highly functioning the company is well respected and has a super positive brand awareness i m never able to go anywhere without getting peppered with raves and happy customer comments and i love wearing company logo gear when i m out for this reason you matter at netflix there is no dead wood everyone is doing something very important to the company or they wouldn t be there what you are doing matters and makes a difference and that feels good you can really make a difference no matter what your role the company often repeats that as an employee you re not on an olympic team meaning you don t do this 24 7 with no life with all focus on the gold we re more of a varsity team playing to win very good but still have to balance with classes and learning we need to have a good work life balance and its very important to the company that we do i think the best thing and its subtle is this no vacation no holiday stuff you work when you work they seem to realize that everyone is working hard and all the time nights weekends often a ton of hard work so if you want to take time off for a vacation a long holiday a day off whatever it happens at your own discretion you don t ask you don t get permission you just do what you have to do no one is keeping track i ve never heard of this kind of policy and you cannot imagine what it doest for your morale for feeling like you re being treated like a grown up for that rule alone i think it stands beyond any other org netflix is not for everyone you don t get direction so much as everyone shares a common understanding of company strategy and goals you are free to work and some will find this harder than just being told what to do netflix doesn t have average workers everyone is high functioning highly motivated and independent and expectations are enormous there is nothing like a career position here there is high turn over and its unnerving to many there is an understanding good average work and productivity does not get a modest raise but a generous severence it s a pro team and the team fit is also as important as the individual performance you could be excellent but if you re not highly communicative cooperative egoless you can get cut just in the team balancing of moving quickly and effectively you must be able and willing to share early and often about everything projects that are new and forming get debated and you have to defend your position and hear critique well recognizing that criticism is of the work and not you is essential a thin skin won t work well quiet hard work doesn t work well for some engineers perhaps you don t ask permission but you must be able to clearly articulate why you do what you are doing and support this position you must realize that ideas are not fragile and only through debate with smart people who share your understanding of company goals and strategy will ideas be improved this is serious work it s really fun but make no mistake it s hard and not for everyone,highly engaged
1 the culture at amazon is it s number one usp it s just awesome there is so much energy and activity so many ideas and leaders actively seeking these idea it s uplifting and addictive 2 the customer obsession here is legendary there are so many stories that it makes you feel proud to be a part of the organization no matter which department you work for the focus is always the customer 3 the freedom to disagree and be heard is another factor if you are one of those who does not follow the crowd and don t hesitate to stand up for your own ideas this place is for you as long as you do it all respectfully amazon is one of the very few organization that actively encourages non conformity and also gives you a platform to put forward your viewpoint without the fear of persecution from management in fact the merits of your idea are explored and if it s convincing enough it becomes the operational procedure 4 the ceo is another great reason i just love jeff he is the man with the vision and this organization is only going to grow as long as he is at the helm he is that rare person who keeps his principles and yet mints profits 5 growth opportunities are numerous for those who are passionate about their job and the chance to take lateral movements and explore other departments is always available 6 amazon is an environmentally conscious organization their efforts as an organization to embrace renewable resources and sustainable practices makes me proud to be associated with them 7 the value system here is unshakable everything runs on the leadership principles you will hear about very often and these are diligently applied there will always be a few bad apples and amazon has great systems to catch and remove them before too much damage is done 8 employee friendly organization when you have a personal crisis and need support you can count on your managers and hr to come through i can go on and on but i think i pretty much made the point if you get the opportunity to work for amazon take it you will not regret it 1 change management could be better sometimes it seem like the leaders have decided to jump into the water with both feet in to test the depth and the average employee is left to deal with the fallout that might cause some anxiety for those who cannot cope with change but eventually things work out as employee feedback is always acted upon 2 compensation is not the best in the market however the flexibility they offer is unparalleled,highly engaged
great people always stimulating talks guest speakers and interesting things going on connected to your work and unrelated amazing benefits fast paced still seems on the cutting edge despite there being lots of younger exciting tech media companies about now a company to feel proud of lots of opportunities to learn and push yourself above average pay very different from the early start up or even mid sized company days understandably corporate crowded there is constant pressure and competition to stand out from the crowd all employees are intelligent and motivated and striving to impress so it s easy to become a mediocre performer if you aren t constantly upping your game can be challenging if you have significant responsibilities outside work but is the best place to work if you are young energetic and relatively free to dedicate most of your life to it,highly engaged
most of the people are smart hardworking and fun very passionate about what they do i ve always had pretty good work life balance with only occasional long weekends and late nights the products have global impact which can be exciting very good pay health coverage and other benefits sometimes a lot of bureaucracy the normal sort you expect from a big company frequent re orgs waste almost a month every year or more slow promotion process to get to a lead or manager position in years there i ve only seen a few people leave lead positions and only a couple people move into lead positions from the individual contributor ranks review process is not fun there s a lot of competition and it s a forced bell curve i spend a large portion of my time working to distinguish myself and grab projects from others so that i could get into the top 30 bracket otherwise you might get randomly laid off if the company is going through a re org sometimes a whole team might get low review scores just because another team was deemed more important supposedly they dumped the review ratings but they still rate you and use that to determine your bonus and promotions and the bonus is still on a forced curve now they just don t tell you the score but you can still figure it out based on the bonus percentage you get also the sde vs sdet thing is not the best however it should be improving in the past sde could dump garbage over the fence and sdet had to test find bugs help with fixes and then get in trouble for slowing down the feature ri or shipping date the company is trying to put more responsibility on the sde s for code quality and if they succeed then great but i ll believe it when i see it,highly engaged

despite the fact that it all boils down to selling products apple makes me feel like i m actually accomplishing something i leave work every day with the feeling that i ve changed and improved our customer s lives which is very rewarding the entire atmosphere of the company is really refreshing and inspires employees to do a great job everyone who works there has a great sense of humor and there s not a single employee there that i don t like the benefits and promotions are a big plus as well as there are literally hundreds of companies giving big discounts to apple employees i always check apple s list of partners before i make any electronics related purchase as 90 percent of them qualify for a discount the most rewarding part of working at the retail store is getting to be the person who introduces customers to the amazing technology that apple comes up with it s an incredible feeling when you open up whole new worlds of productivity and creativity to strangers as part of their intensive training there are a few mandatory meetings every month that could possibly conflict with time off the retail store is a customer service job so you do have to interact with customers most of them are happy and are thrilled to see the awesome products but occasionally you ll get some really pissy customers who have just had their computer fried and think you re to blame working at the front as a greeter can be pretty stressful and hectic which really wear an employee out after a few hours there really aren t too many downsides to the job i really do love working there,highly engaged
comp benefits and perks are incredible company culture is so so good i ve had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career it also feels like senior and c level management really cares about employees it feels like facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person but be sure to ask for what you need nobody s a mind reader for eng bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea i freaking love my team and i get to own my decision to join that team rather than some hiring allocation manager deciding where i get to go very few operational rules bureaucracy i can ssh into any machine i need to if someone s fighting a fire anywhere in the company and i am able to help i feel like i can always jump in to help i really like infra so being at a big company like fb is super fun oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight there s a little bit of an always on the grid culture which contributes towards the 4 5 work life balance but it s generally not too hard to fight it most people who work a lot end up doing it because they re passionate about their work anyway,highly engaged
compensation is par up to the 2 year mark be prepared for total compensation package we hire smart motivated people hiring bar is constantly rising self directed projects you find a gap to fill and make it happen its up to you total compensation package is essentially broken down as follows base pay is 65 75 of base pay at other places then they add a 2 year bonus which will be either paid monthly or yearly in a lump negotiable don t let the recruiters tell you its not after 2 years the bonus that filled the gap in pay disappears and they start paying you roughly the same amount in stock for the next 2 years which lets be clear is an asset not a base talk to your cpa i speculate the reason for this is that most people tend to leave just before or slightly after the two year mark or just before 18 months is average and often folks are encouraged to leave since they are now crufty darwinian culture yeah you ve heard others say that and its true but i wanted to break this down a bit as many assumptions can be made from that statement strong survive ok you get it right no you may not see the whole picture i m not talking about a mentality that pertains only to who can be the most aggressive but rather who is younger faster and often has the least experience experience is frowned upon at amazon and will hold you back because you will likely take some time to consider the whole picture and a large well formed thought doesn t align well with a company with fast nimble small groups that are expected to above all deliver for instance i found it easier to deliver year 1 than year 2 and beyond comradeship team feeling this is a mixed bag of course but if you are the kind of person who likes to align to a team and start delivering once you understand the way they do things this company is not for you teams mentalities are moving targets that are different from one day to the next code reviews will often be a conflict as they constantly move flip flop as an example nobody is anyone s friend no matter how much they emphasize everyone being a customer and customer first interpersonal communication is commonly disregarded and only used to bad mouth people during review time after all how can you be an awesome smart nice person in a dog eat dog company where you are encouraged to disregard others while in search of data or the truth new hires specifically from colleges are commonly put on a pedestal by management this is partly because of the experience piece i mentioned above but also bezo s and co deeply believe that being young is a guarantee of innovation see the leadership principles learn and be curious invent and simplify biased for action don t get me wrong new hires are awesome and people are great in general not just at amazon i ve personally mentored many interns and the experience has been rewarding for all parties but i go out of my way to do right by them as people not just future amazon employee s after breaking down the darwinian culture a little this has some side effects that may not be completely obvious but likely would be to an experienced manager 1 with no focus on building a human culture discounting that people are in fact human what they mean by culture at amazon has nothing to do with finding a groove or alignment to an idea it has more to do with maintaining a cold demeanor 2 a cold demeanor lends itself to override human nature and to become fairly robotic those who are fast at identifying robotic work and pushing it off to other teams are praised and everyone team is a target 3 since everyone is a target for things to be pushed on its easy to make the assumption that others have great intention of malice at first however they may not sincerely have this some do but because there are soo many teams with this mentality your day to day experience will bring you lower and lower while they push you to deliver and focus on new things to deliver 4 the focus on new things is easily perceived by existing employees as a challenge to work harder or be left behind this is also encouraged as amazonians believe we work better under pressure this adds alot of pressure to be sure and does not lend itself to a worker with a family children relationship that takes more than 20 25 of his her time outside work outside work time is still amazon time unless you are a principal 5 principles at amazon have been here a long time either because they hold patents from the early days or because they are aggressive they often are in positions where they work on special projects that sound grand because they change many systems at once but if you break it down they are maintenance projects and other work nobody else can do because they lack perspective and deep knowledge of amazon specific systems as they have not seen the systems evolve this perspective can not be hired for as it is specific to amazon and amazon systems principals tend to stick around amazon for that reason and when they do leave they work on similar things outside amazon or re create very similar systems 6 out of the org i work with only vp s and principals have existing relationships and or children and this would appear to be commonplace see the former numbers for reasons i ve seen a large number of people in their 40 s just now starting to get married or have kids these people again either being at amazon a long time or being principals who would seem to be untouchable by management 6 you will likely never hear anything like the following from a manager or possibly a co worker hey how are you doing we all blindly shuffle by each other on the sidewalk if not ignoring each other we are often trying to speak about technical things convincing others of some fact or trying to gain information for due diligence you seem tired are you ok no don t count on hearing this from a manager they aren t concerned for you you chose to work that 18 hour day good for you must be because you didn t scope something properly or didn t estimate your operations load properly how can i help i ve done my best to break people of not asking this encouraging the culture to be helpful more like the cs people do for amazon customers amazing job they do i don t understand this can you help me understand assumptions will be made about your presentations by most and often assumptions that lead people in a bad direction you will learn how to pre empt this and it will consume alot more time than you think all those edge cases that are unlikely can we figure this out together no we cant if you don t drive it deliver it and promote it yourself you will have a bad review final thoughts i m confident that several trained motivated amazonians have read or are reading this correcting my every mistake and discounting everything here on technicalities i can t help you i will go on with my life doing the best i can while meeting new great people on the way it s true that my best its not good enough i agree something we both have in common as we were hired at amazon vocally self critical i refuse to fail however and not hacking it at amazon is no failure we all age do your best to picture where you will be when you are 55 will you be thinking of amazon as a positive experience that changed you for the better or will it be a footnote great people don t just accumulate knowledge knowledge is only a component of greatness but not the root itself greatness is to acknowledge that people are flawed and that we are all in this together great people all have a great need to make a contribution to better humanity they are driven by this not by personal appetite and narrow focus at least thats the world i fight for,highly engaged
truly the best people to work with the place is amazing for that and i made some really fantastic friends store is great fun work can be fun too with a real family vibe on the floor there is a strong team ethic and everybody wants to help each other out management and people team are really understanding and there is wicked support available if you need it company benefits and discounts festive period and launch days are always good fun too too many customers can be a nightmare and so precious about their apple products like they ll die if their phone doesn t work its just a phone i know people who have progressed far into the company and lots of others like me who didn t i always went that extra mile for my customers which is one of the most important parts of the service but because my numbers weren t good enough i was never really considered for a promotion echoes of we don t care about the numbers are injected into you from day one but that couldn t be further from the truth if progression is what you are after if you want to go through the ranks you have to suck a bit of that d to get there and the right d at that crappy working weekends all the time if you are part time also since jobsy died the company has stopped exceeding expectations now it just delivers what the customers want which is a bit tacky i mean an ipad pro gross,highly engaged
fantastic brand it s an immediate conversation starter and attention grabber when people realize you work for microsoft also there are phenomenal people that work in this company my peers and employees have enhanced my working relationship with microsoft beyond words there are some amazing opportunities as well if you ensure that you re the obvious choice and best fit for those opportunities innovation and unique experiences are welcomed and appreciated in most orgs though surprisingly frowned upon in others i ve gained more substantial experience from microsoft than any other organization i ve worked for though there are ups and downs as in any employee employer relationship i wouldn t trade the time i ve worked at microsoft for anything i feel more optimistic about my future outside of the company because of my accomplishments inside of the company culture payrate and benefits can vary from division to division for similar roles and hard work is often unrewarded and trumped by politics to take advantage of some of the best opportunities relocation some paid some unpaid is often required and modifications to benefits pay is the norm also the classic mentality of bad managers cause disengagement with the organization while great managers keep you motivated to perform at your best and inspired for what the future with microsoft may hold is very much a part of working at microsoft i ve had some managers lie to me and peers and manipulate situations while others have recognized me with bonuses and top company recognition work life balance is also hit or miss depending on the org that you work in my experience is that as long as you sacrifice and overwork yourself to exceed expectations you earn your balance in the work life arena what may be expected from senior management at the top of the company in regards to the organization s values and expectations can be executed completely differently depending on the org and the managers that are above you,highly engaged
benefits you will have excellent benefits here i ve had a few procedures done and did not have to pay anything out of pocket by far the absolute best most affordable benefits i ve ever had discounts without getting into too many details i will say that the discounts offered to the employees are reasonable i have definitely used mine and i m grateful for them i ve always loved apple products so this was just icing on the cake work from home there are a lot of scams out there concerning working from home this is one of the few opportunities that truly offer a job that you can do from the comfort of your home and actually make money its not invasive and they really allow you to be independent you re not really micromanaged per say but just know you will not be able to pretend you re working salary i would say that what i got hired for is well worth what i m paid i no longer feel that way because i ve been cross trained on so many things and have not received a raise i am way more valuable to the company then when i first started therefore i feel i should be compensated for that value i believe that it would be fair to increase the pay per skill but overall the starting pay is well above the minimum wage i m able to live comfortably and i m able to do things that i enjoy that i wasn t able to do with the previous pay with other jobs perks you get a lot of perks here at apple i m unable to go into details but the company does really take care of their employees from a material and health standpoint changes changes and more changes things change all the time as with any business however with apple some of their changes can affect your overall position and pay for example you can be hired as a chat advisor but if the need permits you ll end up on the phones another example is you can be working on night shift but then end up on day shift if the need permits nothing is set in stone you can be moved around or changed to go somewhere else at any moment apple does not care how it affects you ongoing training with no pay increases you will get hired for one thing but you will be crossed trained for everything else they re goal is to have all advisors knowledgeable about all products they want everyone to be able to float around and provide support anywhere needed i had been working two months on my own and my stats were horrible i was still trying to get familiar with what i was trained to do however despite my lack of knowledge and ongoing horrible stats which clearly showed i was not ready to take on new products they trained me on two other products within a month of each other i did not receive a pay increase i was totally stressed out and was about to quit several times i expressed my anxiety to my manager but they were not able to assist me managers are puppets i have nothing bad to say about managers other than i feel so sorry for them you can tell they really want to do something different other than what their superiors are advising them to do there is alot of pressure on them their managers are pressing them to get this done by this date with each member on their team most of the time when you take a problem to them they will not hear you out they will only make excuses as to why something is the way it is i really do believe that is how they re trained so i don t blame them don t expect your manager to be able to assist you with much they are not trained to do that they are trained to protect the brand which ultimately means if its not affecting the customer they really do not care the only thing they are concerned about is your stats anything outside of that they really don t care about you will dread launches launches are suppose to be a exciting time but if the customers you support are directly affected by the launches you will eventually hate them i hate whenever apple launches anything new although they test and test and test the product software it never works straight out of the box apple is a industry giant but when it comes to product releases i have yet to experience one that went smooth customers go absolutely nuts business owners scream at you curse you and all kinds of things its terrible itunes and other non technical departments do not have to deal with launches stats will kill you i really don t want to get much into this but i will say this it is very hard to have good stats a customer can chat in you help them chat back in and the next person don t help them the customer gets your survey and mark it negatively based on what the other advisor did the customer can chat with you you send them to the apple store they have a bad experience at the store but then use the survey from their interaction with you and complain about their store experience yes you can get penalized for what someone else did i understand how this could happen but there should be a way for the managers to correct this the reason this is so important is because this affects promotions salaries everything currently there is no way to move a survey to the correct person that the customer is complaining about if its your survey then its your negative mark even if the customer was not complaining about you the stuck syndrome because apple offers such a good pay and good benefits perks if you decide that you hate working for apple but you don t have a degree or experience to be able to leave the company and find a job that will pay you the same you ll be stuck this is exactly what has happened to me since working for apple i have moved and purchased a car i thought this was my dream job and that i would retire from here one day now i wish i had not purchased anything or moved that way i could have at least found another job still moved and purchased a

the amazon corporate culture values are the best in the world we obsess over customers some companies claim to care about customers but from my experience working in retail management for other companies what they do does not even come close to what amazon does we pioneer innovate and value the opinions of employees and customers at all levels we truly listen to both customers and employees i have personally worked on many initiatives to put associate feedback into action some of the best ideas come from our front line employees we listen to their feedback about barriers they face and improvements that can be made to make their job easier or better and we take action to improve those things quickly this includes anything from adding more food options in the breakroom to making multi million dollar investments into new technology equipment process improvements etc the career opportunities are virtually limitless while i was a leader in operations within the fulfillment centers i personally reviewed resumes helped with interview prep provided opportunities for associates to take on new and challenging roles and personally promoted over 30 well deserving associates from front line employees into management positions in a span of only about 2 3 years within my own career i have had an opportunity to run a department area within a fulfillment center as an area manager where i was able to directly support train and mentor a large team of associates i was then able to transition into an aces continuous improvement manager role where i received expert level training development and experience on lean six sigma process improvement strategies equivalent to that of a black belt i got promoted into a operations manager role where i was managing other operations area managers and leading a very large team of associates in a fulfillment center i was even able to participate in an innovative new rotational program where my only job was to listen to the needs of both associates and managers and ensure that their feedback for improvements got put into action as quickly as possible we call this voices in action this included anything from adding better flavors of creamer for the free coffee to adding more fans for better airflow in specific hot spots in the fc to providing career skills training to associates wanting to promote and grow in their careers to providing mentorship and development training to new managers still learning how to be great leaders the fact that amazon would invest so much into supporting its employees speaks volumes to the culture of the company and that they are not just talking the talk they are walking the walk through my experiences within operations i wanted to make a bigger impact on the way the we onboard train and continuously develop employees at all levels of the organization so i was able to transfer into a new role where i am now a part of the north american learning and talent development team that continues relentlessly to improve every aspect of how we setup new and existing amazonians for success in their career i am empowered and encouraged to try new ideas solve problems collaborate with other teams innovate on behalf of both internal and external customers and i love what i do i also get the opportunity to work with some of the most intelligent talented and motivated people on the planet with a huge amount of diversity which just further adds to the quality of work that we do as a team and how well we are able to serve our customers and fellow amazonians i even helped a member of my family get a job here through a job recommendation because i knew he would love it too we provide stock to all amazon employees at all job levels the stock was somewhere around 340 a share when i joined about 4 years ago now it is almost 2 000 a share and just keeps going up the only hard thing about that is not know when or if you should ever sell it amazon wants all of its employees to feel personally invested in the success of the company and they do this by making everyone an owner both figuratively and literally with stock it feels great to know that the value we add to the company through our everyday work also gets rewarded through out ownership in amazon stock,highly engaged

i actually loved microsoft when i first started the projects i worked on were fun and my coworkers were a blast to work with while i d only intended to be there for a year i ended up signing on as an fte and staying for many years thereafter you couldn t beat the health benefits and the prospect for personal growth was tremendous you ll meet a lot of extremely passionate extremely brilliant employees while working there and those friendships and professional connections will last me a lifetime the review system is utterly broken it works in such a way that some people have to be the bad employees even if every single person on the team is doing a great job this in turn creates a culture in which employees are constantly competing with one another rather than working together to create something great i worked myself exceptionally hard for over 5 years destroying all semblance of a work life balance to leave ms all of one level higher than when i joined despite great reviews every year i could not make headway in furthering my career when i became passionate about solving other problems i felt punished for it as it wasn t part of my core competencies and therefore that work didn t count towards my overall output as an employee near the end of my employment the frequency of re organization efforts was just absurd and spoke to poor mismanagement from the executive leadership being uprooted and put onto new projects once in a while is one thing but being moved around every few months with often no input as to where you d best fit into the company gets exceptionally grating and demoralizing the days in which you can manage your career at microsoft are long gone at least from my experience in the game division you are a cog in a larger machine and will be moved accordingly when it it deemed necessary,highly engaged

there are many things said about working for google so it makes no sense to reiterate them but yes the perks are great and the compensation is competitive and there are very few places that are that much fun to work at what makes working for google special is the projects you re working on instead of re implementing old concepts you can spend your time on working on new concepts that haven t been done before if you re passionate about changing the world this is the place to do it at and the people you work with are just as great incredibly smart and motivated and a real pleasure and inspiration to work with in the end isn t that what s most important feeling that you re making a difference and doing something useful and doing it with people you enjoy working with there are a few people who ve grown lazy or are waiting for their stock to vest but fortunately they are a minority and in my daily life it isn t an issue at all it depends a bit on the team you re on though also google is the new favorite target in the press while a huge amount of what is written is still positive it does sometime require shaking off some wildly speculating headlines and being very careful what you tell the press if that s a part of your function,highly engaged

i worked at the fulfillment center for the summer and it was a great experience working in the outbound department i had very friendly and understanding team members leaders and management since they re set up as four days off three days off i never felt overwehlmed when working there after 90 days they offered to hire me as a regular associate rather than just a seasonal employee and subsequently that s when you re eligible to recieve an amazing benefit package i personally loved the company culture there in a way i looked forward to stand up at the beginning of shifts and after lunch becasue everyone was always so upbeat and friendly they definitely expect a lot out of you but my team was very understanding and looked to correct my mistakes rather than condone them the only reason i left was because school started again while they were open and willing to work around my class schedule i ultimately turned it down because my courseload was too much for me to handle while i can t speak for other locations i personally had a great experience and highly recommend working for amazon while i personally didn t find this to be an issue the ten hour work days can be taxing the position i was in required me to work quickly and correctly basically they track your speed and quality meaning you had to be highly self motivated and work was very fast paced it was a warehouse so expectations must be kept in check but some days the ten hour shifts could become very grueling and monotonous while i had a great experience with management working there i had heard from other employees that it hadn t always been like that so your experience may vary lastly the point system implemented there made it very easy to be fired if you racked up enough points while this wasn t a problem for me if showing up on time staying the full shift and not missing any shifts is a problem i would look elsewhere for employment,highly engaged

the best thing about working at microsoft is being surrounded by bright people i love the experience of not being the smartest person in the room and being able to learn from my peers the compensation is reasonable the benefits are excellent and there are great opportunities for professional development an advantage of working for a big company and something that is entrenched in the microsoft culture is the ability to easily switch teams it s nice to know that if i ever get tired of my current problem space i have the option of branching out and trying something completely different while i believe microsoft has been going to great pains to improve their compensation and bonus model it s still far from perfect individual managers wield a huge amount of power when it comes to deciding an employee s review numbers you are literally relying on your manager to fight for you if you ve been unfortunate enough to get on your manager s bad side watch out adding to this problem is the fact that there s little oversight in the review model it s frustrating knowing that you risk getting screwed if you re not willing to suck up,highly engaged

excellent benefits even as a part timer it s also great to introduce or reinforce customer s experience to apple products which are the best in the world i love the fast paced environment and constant change of working for apple it s a job that allows you to learn a lot from experience and also from training the interaction with customers is energizing exploitive apple retail keeps people in the lower paying rung of specialist while utilizing your expertise to fill in for people who get paid more doing tech and training and not promoting it s getting worse and worse many would be willing to be utility players and do more than one role but the pay and official title stays on the lower scale i also think there is a bait and switch in the recruiting process where apple contacts people with training and tech skills with the promise of creative or genius lures them to work for apple but then keeps them in the red zone lots of part time positions with crappy and inconsistent hours i know this is retail managers are increasingly micromanaging issues to keep employees from progressing for silly rules i e gum chewing and color or pattern or shirts worn under apple shirt and employees who give great customer experiences nps are not acknowledged in terms of advancement it has more to do with kissing up to management and saying the correct corporate gobbelty gook suck ups are rewarded age ism can be an issue at some stores pay is not great employee store meetings are rah rah annoying people are feeling unhappy about the lack of movement outside hires are poisonous standards regarding experiences and benchmarks for roles are a personality contest,highly engaged

attention to detail for an obsessive character like me i always loved the attention to detail the way the tiles for each store come from a particular part of apple s quarry the way the own the forrest where they get he wood to make the tables the way the guys that made the wooden tables travel around and then stand and refinish them this fine psychotic attention to detail is why apple is apple this is why their products packaging stores os etc all are so far ahead of everyone else they are uncompromising on this and it is a beautiful thing they were fairly dynamic in managements ability to make change with in the store some cool discounts on products none on the iphone when i was there lets first of all state that this is apple retail and can in no way reflect on the experiences at apple inc i always said that apple retail is like apple s red head step child so please take that into account when reading the following pay it is quite low at the time they paid approx 18 an hour people at coles earn more then that this has improved somewhat but it is still about 21 hour they pump you up on all this we are apple we are different buzz expect you to go above beyond yet pay you less then a checkout person all the while you read about executives getting bonuses in the half billion dollar range a toxic culture apple is like a religion even if you don t believe then you need pretend for fear of being ousted see i really love what apple stands for and always will the underlying principles the history the innovation i know all of it and it was that passion and difference that i relayed to customers but am i going to cheer and run out yelling at an ipad lunch like jesus has been resurrected no i find it fake and insulting so what i found is that employees fall into two categories 1 drones 2 free thinkers the free thinkers who love the company eventually get over all the evangelistic fakeness and the yes men which only leaves one choice leaving the company the staff turnover was jaw dropping this is a sign of a company with issues drones apple retail finds staff that are really passionate about the brand which is a great starting point though when you get to apple core the first week of training things go off on a weird kind of superficial tangent where new recruits are exposed to the wacky insides of apple which means watching endless promo videos and listening to recruits try to perpetually out do each other s responses to empress the facilitators i was shocked and communicated to family that it was like some crazy cult where everyone talks about how amazing everything is but no one is being real i found another person at my training who i sussed out and quietly asked is this crazy or what we both secretly discussed how odd and almost scary everything was at my colleague s core there was a guy that was so freaked out that he just stood up and said sorry guys i am going to leave this just isn t for me and walked out see finding passionate people is a good idea but this should be paired with people that also highly value honesty as where hyped up employees go wrong is when you promote a kind of fake positive environment that mirrors a toxic religion people with strong personalities that choose to be honest and upfront get over the way in which the retail arm is run and thus choose to move onto a more healthy environment in my experience this leaves behind brain washed individuals with little drive and ambition who are willing to just do what they are told use the lingo get paid poorly and cheer like madmen at launches for example a manager asked me to come and read an email he was about to send when i asked why me he stated because i know you will tell me what you really think during my time at apple i noted a lot of switched on and passionate employees leave as they just couldn t take the fakeness anymore so when all these people leave you get left with a bunch of yes men an example of drone behaviour is with the most recent pay increase the employees agreed to an increase that was below the rate of inflation which means with each passing year their purchasing power diminishes thats crazy thing to do for any rational person apple lingo they use a lot of apple lingo for internal communication and provide guidelines for communication this is good as it sets a benchmark and tone for communication that is supposed to be healthy but you can t just have normal conversations with people you need to use internal buzz words i got corrected this a few times i was also told that i was suitable for more higher management roles but i would need speak more apple i replied that i know all the terminology but i am not the kind of person to consistently regurgitate buzz words poor internal promotion if you want to progress your career in the ranks of a solid company don t choose apple retail i watched people enter with this goal and eventually leave i also know two guys that i work with that have stuck with that specific store only to stay at the same level they tend to promote from outside and people stay static in their respective roles maybe that is a side effect of the drone issue that i stated above,highly engaged

i work as a software development manager for amazon at seattle what i like most about working at amazon is the ability to make large scale impact on the way the world buys stuff and i get to do that of my own accord autonomy independent thinking and ownership are encouraged here better than any other place that i know of amazon is a great place for builders and if you enjoy building things robots at home software at work the works then you will love working here as you will hear a lot of amazonian s say there is scale and then there is amazon scale i do not know of any other place that provides the cusp of physical scale and computing scale that amazon provides physically moving goods across the world based on some person clicking a buy now button on the website and doing it a very large number of times very day brings with it some very interesting including several unsolved problems it is a lot of fun to work on such problems amazon is also a place that rewards diversity of thinking and approach that has brought together a whole bunch of very interesting and smart people i learn a lot every day that i show up at work amazon also has one of the most flexible internal move policies so it is super easy to find something within the company that you are interested in working on and start working on it it is a very fast paced environment where something is happening all the time never a dull moment that includes spirited white board discussions quick team stand ups and some noisy friday evenings the speed at which amazon is growing resonates across the company this has had some downside in terms of big company features showing up at work sometimes there is process that builders may not enjoy as much there is a lot of active push back against unnecessary process and the good part is that at amazon it does change things but still it feels like a big company sometimes another aspect of having a fast moving builder culture with a lot of smart people is that it can be overwhelming at times sometimes i have felt that things are moving too fast and i have to play catch up,highly engaged
it is a great work environment with a great team you get to sell incredible products to other people that are passionate about them and you aren t paid on commission this allows brutal honesty and also a high level of trust between sales person and the customer apple really emphasizes the customer experience and wants to treat every customer as if they were in a 5 star hotel the store was always incredibly busy and frequently understaffed it was a generally stressful environment but being that the team was so close it really wasn t that bad the worst part about this job is that they force feed you the apple kool aid which in and of itself i am not opposed to i love apple i love their ideals and i love their products however the unfortunate consequence is that every person there is basically a die hard apple employee and many of them believe if you stay long enough you will move high up in the food chain after 2 3 years you realize you won t i had some friends that were around 4 5 years in my store and they were incredible people fantastic with customers knowledgable about every aspect of the business and constant over performers however at some point they realized wow there really isn t anywhere to go apple frequently hires store managers from other chains like gap starbucks banana republic and infrequently promote directly within it is a great place to work but there is a very large ceiling there that is virtually impossible to break through without leaving and working elsewhere for experience first,highly engaged
apple is an innovative company on the cutting edge of the market the company itself has grown immensely in a relatively short amount of time and that reason alone could be enough to jump on the bandwagon but when you combine the huge growth over the last few years with excellent products and one of the best customer service philosophies i ve seen it s ends up being a great place to work apple employees get to interact with real people on a daily basis just talking about what works for them and solutions they ve found in a laid back informative and fun environment and because apple is in the incredibly fast moving technology market there s never a dull moment as new products services and upgrades are always just around the corner oh and the discount s not to shabby either the downside with working at a retail store for apple are the same downsides in any retail environment employees must inevitably deal with down time on the nice weather days endure the unreasonable and selfish customer issues and start low on the totem poll in terms of wages aside from the normal retail items one must be comfortable with being referred to as a member of the apple cult this is a common statement from many people who aren t involved in the company additionally one must be comfortable with secrecy and a lack of communication from apple corporate all new inventions upgrades shipment information changes in staffing etc is kept incredibly secret ie very often don t have any information on a new product until it arrives at the door 10 minutes before the store opens,highly engaged
it is amazing to work for one of the biggest companies in technology history retail can provide you with hundreds of different opportunities for going corporate you can even get sponsored to go and work for corporate and they will pay for you to live at a corporate location and work for them there this is a company that provides growth on many levels for internal employees and has wonderful benefits even for part timers apple provides paid leave for family needs and has vision dental and great healthcare they offer 401k and stock options as well as donating to any nonprofit you may volunteer for apple is fantastic to work for the retail management is really rough for the most part they bring in people from other retail companies not realizing that none of these people know what our day to day jobs are we have to explain technology to customers daily and yet our management knows barely anything about technology they are simply the mouth puppets of whoever is running the corporate values side of retail at corporate there is nothing like this but in retail they discuss competencies and more to sound like their boring management means something they don t care about development for each employee they just care about their salary and making sure customers don t get upset there are a few managers who get it but not enough to make a difference apple really needs to change the way they pick their retail managers,highly engaged
culture work comp allowed to have life outside of work pm role is shifting to more product focused role while still maintaining technical nature pms are not dev babysitters here which is fantastic i feel like i can be myself coming into work everyday which is a great motivating feeling it seems it s 50 50 on if you like where you get placed or not half love where they are and half do not also as with working at almost any large company decisions are usually top down and it s pretty meeting driven meetings are not inherently a bad thing but it s especially apparent here,highly engaged

the apple culture is a great way to learn to deal with ambiguity and decent company to work for they provide resources and motivation to move in the company the biggest pro is the people that you encounter while working there they are the best people you could ask to work with friendly and welcoming the entire culture can be very warm there is fairly little room for upward mobility in the retail side of things apple hires very enthusiastic people who are mostly highly intelligent and motivated trying to get ahead can both be rewarding and frustrating because everyone is at mostly the same level after a while it seems as if there is no more room for motion inside the little world that they have built the culture is fun at first but can be overwhelming,highly engaged

among the best reasons to work at microsoft are the people you get to work with by surrounding yourself with highly talented passionate and very smart people you ll find you learn a large amount about making great software i truly appreciate the work ethic and care many of my co workers put into our products we really strive to make the best software we can other reasons it is a great place to work include the beautiful seattle area amazing health benefits and the numerous opportunities to get involved with others who share common interests personally i d like to try out a smaller company at some point in my life while microsoft is very large and has many opportunites to choose from in almost any technical area i d like to try out the small business scene the base pay is greater than the average software development job within the us but by no means is near the top i do believe however that the bonus awards work life balance and health benefits do outweight the lower wage,highly engaged
good starting salary great way to meet new people you can learn a lot from upper management not just about the job itself but about life they hire the best and so you can feed off of others and learn a lot i loved engaging people making people succeed very hectic if your not use to walking 20 or 30 miles then its not for you long hours a lot of different views on how a process can be dealt with and in some cases management does not care what you think unless you have a degree good luck moving up even if your an amazing associate who stands out they will give you an opportunity to interview but thats it they will just outsource management right out of college there are a lot of suck ups there and they only look out for themselves so beware,highly engaged
many of the engineers are genuinely good within their bounds they exhibit a desire to get work done the tooling is excellent deployments globally are a breeze and one can gather great insights from the metrics pay and benefits are amazing please stop firing amazing talent other posts here paint the wrong picture that those who survive at netflix are the best it is inaccurate at best the quality of many of those let go is not in doubt but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability many who stay are very bright but many who are let go are as well if you do not tow engineering s backwards line you are looked down upon people live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go a mentality of better him than me it is not survival of the fittest it is a blind thought police who speak openly about wanting to hear others opinions as long as the opinion agrees with theirs and then balk when they are actually given alternatives are not actually wanted obedience and maintaining the status quo are if you are to be disruptive you must be disruptive in their way if that makes no sense it is because it is truly illogical one can hope this is not so pernicious as to infect every team and i would dare to say that it isn t but do your homework and know what you are getting yourself into,highly engaged
apple is a fun place to work the employees are great and the customers can be kooky but they are rather terrific as well if you are passionate about apple products you will enjoy yourself immensely the managers are also helpful in personal development the benefits are out of this world even for part time employees and they are only getting better also the job isn t commission based so there is less pressure to sell and more camaraderie amongst employees there is not as much room for growth as i would like after a while it is easy to feel dispensable the turnover rate can be high there isn t much flexibility with hours and it gets difficult to manage a good work life balance,highly engaged

i worked for microsoft for 20 years and i couldn t be happier to be a cheerleader in the market place and workforce for my former company microsoft has been doing excellent innovation and it was a pleasure to have been a part of the corporation and see the evolution of those products and services during my tenure i went from a technical writer to a director and felt microsoft had my back as an employee the company has clear values that put customers first but never at the expense of the employees we worked toward clear goals in my organization office and were rewarded for innovation and results the everyday benefits of working for microsoft are simply amazing great 5 star restaurants i wouldn t call them cafeterias soccer fields baseball diamonds fantastic medical benefits that include vision and dentistry employee stock purchase plan generous 401k and the pay is on the high side for the industry while microsoft was a growing enterprise the work life balance was tilted toward the work end of the equation however it started to become clear that employee burnout is not a good strategy and microsoft started putting a higher emphasis on work life balance,highly engaged
3 days off was amazing 40 hour work week 10 hours day were kinda hard but fun with paid overtime and holidays paid vacation if you saved up enough hours unpaid time off was good for emergency s the benefits are amazing too i loved all the people i worked with we basically became a family in a way if you work hard the management will notice and moving up is possible for hard working employees i had great managers i was so thankful some dock managers don t communicate effectively together and can be more focused on numbers than the quality of production at the expense of the worker depending on the manager on that shift they train you on almost everything with no additional pay raise unless you get a pa promotion,highly engaged

absolutely incredible pay benefits i m making more than i ever imagined 1 reason i haven t left flexible work environment not tied to a desk all day can go outside work at a google cafe etc lack of structure means can define own job execute on what you think is important resume builder google looks great on your resume finance is a 2nd class function at best and in general has very limited power within the organization this can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org often those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in engineering product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest sure that acquisition looks fabulous and it s only 100m i can make an analysis that makes it look great even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful vps in eng is intense this is compounded by the hyper reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong finance is primarily full of investment bankers consultants with little folks with actual corp finance experience this causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don t understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it seriously within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we re moving to a monthly forecast view instead at first i tried very hard to get more corp finance folks in the org but now i actually think ibankers do best as folks with actual cf experience tend to be so shocked by the google processes or lack thereof they simply cannot hang work life balance is dreadful since the employee base is generally young and former bankers most folks don t seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work this can be painful especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere google elects not to use erp or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions then they don t staff these solutions with adequate eng resources result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be scrappy to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data upside is that without a data source no one s likely to know if you re completely off base but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions there are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at google particularly if you don t support the search ads business forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 q to achieve this is a social extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don t even if the folks who don t are doing a superior job i ve taken advantage of it myself but it s not fair,highly engaged

there are a lot of great things about working at amazon as a recruiter it s the fastest growing large company in the world so it has a lot of resources and a lot of challenges that will help you improve as a recruiter most of the people you work with especially the teams you support are extremely smart and fun people amazon is a well known and a mostly sought after employer you help build teams that build products that impact tens or hundreds of millions of people and often make the news they are slowly but steadily improving the benefits to their employees more supportive parental leave policies more liberal internal transfer policies better offices buildings they also generally pay well against the overall market they are a challenging place to recruiter as well while that can be less than fun at times it means you will become a better recruiter quickly i m pretty confident that someone who can successfully work at amazon for a year or two can go on to be successful at pretty much any other company they also have nice little perks like fishbowls talks or performances by popular speakers or up and coming bands and the holiday summer party were fun like i mention above amazon is a challenging place to work in recruiting they have grown insanely fast over the last five years so they have tapped the us and canadian markets pretty hard already finding new engineering talent who seem qualified and haven t interviewed in the past is very difficult they have unrealistic expectations on their recruiters that add unnecessary everyone who works there is very serious about their job and has strong opinions most are good at listening to other people and making decisions based on data but you need to be able to take critique and work with other people people will push back on your ideas while amazon is pretty competitive in the area of compensation perks i don t feel it is very competitive for it s level of company by that i mean if you compare them to the overall tech market they are very competitive however the people who are considering amazon are typically also looking at places like facebook google and uber the compensation perks at those places are a definite step up from what amazon offers so even if you enjoy working at amazon it makes it difficult to stay there when you hear you can get a significant raise work on equally awesome projects and get all your meals free at a competitor,highly engaged

great company with an amazing culture you work hard the pace is fast expectations are high and change is constant but facebook really looks after its employees and provides a diverse array of opportunities for self development cross functional training and career growth the ceo meets with all employees once a week and answers anyone s questions most people here are energetic and passionate about their work and seriously focused on making an impact the work environment is physically and culturally very open open spaces no offices casual dress etc work life balance is respected and encouraged and you have the flexibility to work in the way that best matches your individual style and needs face to face communication is highly valued but meetings are generally focused on not time wasting activities anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen there is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers the compensation benefits and perks are truly above par one of the most important things for me is the open culture and the way facebook encourages employees to find and be our authentic selves and to listen to the voices of others who may be different from ourselves the company works very hard to create a diverse and welcoming environment for all it may be hard to adjust in the first few months if you re used to working in a traditional company you can t sit in a corner and work alone cross functional teamwork and building relationships are the norm facebook is always in the public spotlight and this is one of the things you ll have to learn to deal with if you want to work here and you ll have to get used to spending more time on facebook,highly engaged
looks great on a resume having worked at google opens many doors and there are lots of opportunities internally compensation benefits are top of the market a majority of coworkers are smart talented well intentioned people gyms exercise classes music rooms language programs are amazing go into it realizing that even though it s google it s still a huge corporate lead by the google culture is mostly a facade there are many programs and tools designed to foster things like psychological safety inclusiveness mindfulness but they are pretty shallow it s like they are there just because that s what progressive companies do they are created and probably managed based on data that the leaders have no idea how to interpret it doesn t come from the heart because ai androids don t have hearts of course i used a contact form to report witnessing blatant sexism by senior leaders my report went unanswered i contacted my hrbp to discuss a sensitive topic s he acted like i was just a bother the legendary perks have faded of course the standard health stock retirement benefits are fantastic but the food and fun budgets are dwindling fast perhaps worst of all like so many prestigious institutions google attracts people who are driven by status the result is that you have too many with slick credentials but mediocre talent and almost no authentic interest in industry then instead of producing great work they get along with strategic elbow rubbing and excessive self promotion speaking of self promotion the performance review process is onerous and unhelpful but not anymore than that at most big companies from what i hear all that said i m incredibly grateful for my job even as i plot my escape if i were a few years younger and more amenable to the corporate lifestyle i d be all in for several years at least,highly engaged
great products as sales person its wonderful to be able to represent the best campus life is good great food beautiful surroundings and the occasional party fun activity at the main lawn compensation and overall benefits matching 401k stock purchase when the stock is rising are definitely competitive smart people and overall the company feels well run they deliver great products somewhat on time they market these products well management seems relatively flat and so you can know meet the top execs and that is cool there is this overall secrecy feel that is weird and i think it permeates many many aspects of the company from engineering to marketing to sales so you are often wondering if you are supposed to know something and not talk about it etc and it makes for a sometimes uncomfortable environment not all mangers are great some are egomaniacs intent on self promotion and kissing up and or micromangers and if one of them is your boss bummer for you work hours can be significant its not an hp 9 5 type of place to work,highly engaged

1 great pay i ve only seen 2 companies google fb in seattle offer more than my current total compensation and while some in the bay area do it s not more after adjusting for cost of living 2 part of an exciting company 3 fast paced 4 hands on experience with massively scaled software 5 very laid back about working from home although this varies from team to team 6 objective merit based analysis for promotions not much office politics or nepotism in my org caveat i ve heard very different things from other orgs 7 good hardware this was not the case at all before 2015 or 2016 now almost every dev has a top of the line macbook pro at least 1 ec2 instance and an ultrawide monitor or 2 regular monitors 1 if you are a new grad hire they may place you on a team that has nothing to do with your interests or what org you were told you would work for when you accepted the offer even if you have 0 experience in that area i ve heard this from at least 10 people it seems to be common 2 extremely high operational load especially in retail 3 fail fast approach and unrealistic deadlines have lead to shortcuts being taken widespread tech debt and a very serious retention problem even the engineers that stay at amazon switch teams every 2 3 years 4 hardly anything is documented including widely used services and tooling building almost anything requires constantly engaging other teams who are often unresponsive or unhelpful tribal knowledge is lost when people leave the team in my first year 80 of the 20 engineers on my team left and this is not uncommon imagine that you have to write an app using a web framework angularjs as an example that you aren t familiar with and you must call 5 services with undocumented apis you aren t allowed to use any documentation at all or refer to any books on angularjs you do have an ide and can contact the creators of the services you need to use this is exactly what it is like developing at amazon it takes the fun out of it entirely and makes building anything much harder than it should be compared to using off the shelf tools libraries and documented apis amazon has been lauded for adopting a service oriented architecture what isn t mentioned is that none of the services are documented even though they have usually multiple clients 5 culture is very cult like 6 the company highly values fresh out of college hires they believe that potential is everything in software engineering though experience can be incredibly important too i suspect they prefer college hires because it is much easier to get them to overwork and they are less likely to have families college teaches data structures algorithms but not software best practices code quality is often very poor 7 the work is challenging only due to the complexity of figuring out what is undocumented interfacing with other teams etc not the actual coding part 8 very difficult to change any entrenched practice even if it can be demonstrated to be ineffective and better alternatives are available 9 management is typically very short sighted schedules are determined by when higher level mgmt wants a project to be completed and all projects must be completed by the end of the current calendar year usually there is little to no input from the actual engineers all that matters is if the code meets the goal or not with little if any consideration on whether it is a ticking time bomb that will be unreliable and require frequent maintenance most code at amazon is not robust and requires 24 7 oncall coverage for frequent breakages,highly engaged
great benefits awesome atmosphere and overall great company hoping the new ceo will free things up across groups to allow unhindered and less political work to get done politics kill innovation and motivation for lots of employees the old ceo way of doing things was to pit teams doing similar work against each other so that the best and brightest idea rose to the surface this often frustrated more creative and introspective types and skewed loyalty to whoever could hold up the brightest glowing orb to the leadership this leads to teams that don t actively accomplish much but talk a lot about doing everything in order to make it look their job is worth keeping around meanwhile the people who are actually accomplishing and solving real day to day business needs are left in the dust to try and justify the work they do it is a real poisonous atmosphere at times and erodes morale,highly engaged

excellent pay and benefits amazing workplace environment and topnotch colleagues it s still the best large corporate to work for in my book if that is you want to work in a large corporate if you re in the right org or product area within the company it is possible to get to work on some fantastic projects and for your career to progress a rising tide lifts all boats as they say however if you are in the wrong org one that is not growing or has poor leadership or mid management get out fast you are on a dead end track and nothing you can do will change that the company has grown so large so quickly and you can really see it is wrestling with all the problems of adolescence with bureaucracy and politics exploding in the years i was there performance management is broken and the best people do not always get the rewards they deserve adept upward management rather than doing the best job has become the surest way to rapid career advanceent this is a real shame and needs to be nipped in the bud asap it is not clear that the senior management are really aware of this or have the means or desire to get to grips with it,highly engaged

benefits from the first day get to work with the most up to date computers schedule can be 5x8 or 4x10 being with the company for years it was great to work for apple inc they made the place a enjoyable place to work you were empowered to make decisions you were celebrated for doing exceptional work the perks and swag was plenty shirts coffee cup blankets muffins served at your desk and great fun celebrations for events overall enjoyable and exciting then steve jobs passed and now you are micro managed audited bullied and constantly being warned of policy or be fired very little chance of promotion the team manager apprentice program allows only a few people in and it can take years for an opening to get in is not what you know it is who you know the good old boy process if you have been withapple longer than 2 years you may not get any promotions at all training is online testing or self guided the company has erased every thing jobs had going on in the sites they painted everything white and grey no quotes from jobs no inspirational notations everything is now focused on profits and employees is the last thing thought about for improvement the bottom of the totem pole that is rotting from being tinkled on,highly engaged

the pay is good the people are amazing the perks are wonderful the company means well but not sure how to deal with the changing sales volume which causes chaos the upper management have their head up their butts they are blind to the hard workers and just love those that use the correct lingo they don t appreciate nor have loyalty of those that have put in their dues new policies and programs that are not in the best interest of the customer are being pushed hard to create sales,highly engaged
the pay is amazing as long as you get a block getting a block is competitive the app has a good flow use of gas and wear and tear on car the navigation is pretty bad sometimes customer service is hard to understand and not helpful if something goes wrong they always blame the employee trying to explain a situation to support was like talking to a brick wall overall though i enjoy the work i think it s fun and again pay is great,highly engaged

microsoft is full of smart passionate people who want to make a difference people generally strive to do their best and work hard which means a lot to me since i care deeply about my work and love being surrounded by people who feel likewise the company supports movement and stretch opportunities and if you work hard you can really make a great career and make a difference workload is pretty high and it can be tough at times to maintain balance but i don t know that it s any different for any other top global company especially in this economy decision making is hard to figure out sometimes at what level is a decision being made who owns it and is it mandatory once made,highly engaged
great benefits brilliant management company seems to care about the staff its customers and its place in the world excellent and exciting opportunities for employees to progress their career and move into other areas both within store and outside of store best retail working experience i ve had difficult to progress within the first year of employment which can be frustrating can be difficult to move from part time to full time need to re interview and go through internal processes not necessarily a bad thing and is a fair way of doing it but can be frustrating,highly engaged

the culture here has low tolerance for politics leaders are very inspiring that keeps the staff motivated the benefits here are great gym allowance medical and dental allowance flexible schedule 15 days annual leave 14 days medical leave leaders are too inspiring that sometimes employees are being brainwashed to do their best in a span of 1 year employees are falling sick getting injured physically due to the high velocity of the work employees are not given the opportunity to rest and reflect we dont even get opportunity to go for upgrading courses,highly engaged
the people i work with are what makes facebook so amazing everyone is legitimately passionate about their work and the impact their having perks and salary aside both of which are great it s amazing going into work every day knowing that what i m doing is having a direct impact on our 1 7 billion and growing every day users i get excited to come into work every day even after 1 5 years and i wouldn t trade that for the world when i first joined one of the things i loved was the internal transparency there were no locked doors and leadership management was always very open about things going on at the company but lately it seems like upper management are keeping more and more things confidential without any explanation as to why,highly engaged
great benefits good discounts on the products getting to learn while on the job awesome t shirts discounted stock excellent company to have on a resume usually a pretty fun work environment day to day the job is pretty cool most coworkers are on the same wavelength as you so it s usually pretty easy to get a long with people higher up in the chain it appears that the top level of management really does listen to employee concerns and they make attempts to address problems unfortunately this is usually botched by local level management overall though it s a great day job but not something i want to do for the rest of my life retail hours including weekends and holidays the occasional obnoxious customer absolutely no transparency from management expectations of work don t match the pay rate promotions are based on manager preference rather than job performance additional responsibilities without pay raises are given to people all the time so they get burnt out summers and holidays are almost unbearably busy at my location specifically i m not a big fan of my management i think they re mostly inept this doesn t reflect on the company as a whole but it s the main reason i m somewhat dissatisfied here beyond my local and market managers it at least appears that there are some competent people but then again we ve never actually met them either,highly engaged
google takes on big audacious challenging problems that give you the opportunity to impact the world you re surrounded by brilliant people who work hard get things done and inspire you to elevate your game there are inspiring world changing projects all around you and even if you have not yet had the opportunity to work on one i find satisfaction just being able to observe from the inside larry has done an amazing job transforming the company from one known for world class engineering to one that also understands and appreciates design and the more human side of building great products maybe most of all i love working at a place that values human rights diversity and acceptance the company is huge there s no denying it larry and his team do a great job of keeping things nimble and making the company feel much smaller than it is but no one can say it feels like a small company anymore in a company filled with hard workers and overachievers it s easy to get too caught up on pay the performance review process and getting promoted this is one reason why maintaining a good work life balance can be challenging and as open and egalitarian as google tries to be their compensation system is very opaque which creates an information asymmetry between employer and employee not different from most places it s just that google makes itself out to be open but this is one area where they are not some product groups value excellence and quality more than others but that s probably true anywhere,highly engaged
great fun always enjoy my job there is never something i and upset about i also love the apple products late working hours and sometimes you have to work weekends but overall there isnt really anything to complain about,highly engaged
benefits are awesome as a leader compensation is great there is the added bonus of having amazon on your resume what you ve heard about the company is true while it can and does work out for many if you are a female over 40 the odds are not in your favor if you are black or latino the odds are not in your favor amazon has a heavy population of white males asians and east indians nothing against any of those groups of people they just do not share the love to everyone else so if you fit into one of those groups you are golden no matter what they tell you delivering results reigns king and it is by any means necessary if you are a people leader you can kiss your personal life goodbye if you have a college degree of any level but you just want to get a foot in the door don t believe it you will be stuck at the lower levels because amazon does not value promoting from within and through the ranks if you are a twenty something fresh face college graduate with zero management experience this is the place for you oh but they won t tell you how those skills that you don t have will come back to bite you later if you are analytical by nature and work better alone do not take a people leader role you will get zero training about how to lead people but you will be held accountable for being able to engage and motivate people if you don t know how don t do it,highly engaged
great work life balance great people leadership great benefits awesome maternity leave amazing career opportunities challenging work the company really cares about its people honestly i don t have any i didn t like the forced performance evaluation cycle but that was changed in 2014 for the best,highly engaged
there are the most amazing people here the people alone are what kept me here for so long it s great to work at a company with a strong and clear mission note that it s pretty good work life balance and you feel valued by the hr benefits team due to the perks ie food gym shuttle health dental discounts dog friendly workplace etc yes google is amazing but not all roles at google are amazing the work is largely reactive for many roles and sometimes you feel like you are fighting for table scraps when it comes to new and exciting work simply because you re surrounded by tons of high performing over achieving but wonderful individuals,highly engaged
facebook is great we have amazing perks financial freedom to do amazing work and coworkers that will push you to become a better professional and person what sticks out most to me is that the company is accutley aware that it won t be able to reach it s long term goals without tenured more than 2 3 years employees it goes to great lengths to remove everyday hassles from your life so you can spend more time doing the things you love outside of work and when life happens babies relocation bereavement it s most amazing perk shines through the people around you come together to support you and give you the time you deserve to move through life changes they really look at it through the lens of if the employee is happy and taken care of then they ll do the best work of their career this doesn t mean that everyone will work 80 hours a week if you question this ask to see the office at 6pm it s pretty empty most people leave closer to 4 is hard to imagine another company to work at this forces you to put a lot of trust in facebook we don t have a ton of great examples of companies caring for someone through their career so it s a bit like walking into the unknown,highly engaged
you can get a lot done if you re on the right team as part of an internal facing team i was able to make a pretty wide impact across global amazon employees many of my coworkers have been incredibly inspiring and supportive at amazon you only do things if you have data to back it up for a while i thought that it was the best idea and totally good for business however i started seeing my coworkers running around chasing their own tails to find data for data s sake rather than to be used as an insight when making a decision unfortunately upper management at least to the vp level is completely obsessed with data to the point that i think some teams are missing out on awesome opportunities also when you are so focused on data which is historic then you miss out on future opportunities i mean did anyone see the fire phone the second gripe every single team does everything their own way i love the idea of it being some sort of wannabe startup culture but when there are 9 independently developed services that do the exact same thing then something is seriously wrong with how you re doing your development work last but not least this odd obsession with leadership principles that completely run the conversations in meetings and even hallway conversations i ve literally heard multiple use the phrase in the spirit of vague insert leadership principle here we should no we shouldn t throw some numbers and a leadership principle into a one page document and you ll impress some people but you won t be breaking any new ground or be innovating whatsoever,highly engaged

working with great people some of which are the best in their industry decent compensation pretty good benefits love being able to commute via shuttles coaches etc beer bashes are fun hours aren t horrendous politics tend to play into your ability to get promoted or your salary increases hr tends to favor management over employee concerns being under a control freak boss i m constantly micro managed career pathways and structure is a bit murky lack of transparency makes it tough to see the big picture apple discounts are pretty meh,highly engaged
working at apple was fun the management treated you like you were valuable to the company and you could see it from day one during training apple cares about the professionalism in which you approach customers as much as the knowledge you have of the products it was one of the best places i have ever worked and i understand why they are successful in todays dry unorganized and mundane stores the discounts that we were able to get were great but again hard to spend 10 20 of your gross income on a macbook and an iphone management was amazing with tough situations involving meeting customer expectations but it was stressful during high volume times such as new product role outs the biggest con was just the pay working full time and still unable to get payed above 24 000 year makes it difficult to look at the retail position as a career,highly engaged
i work in the aws division as a cloud support engineer and i have never seen a smarter group of engineers a huge amount of employees here have masters or higher level education so even the people in lower level positions are experts in something you probably arent this provides an amazing learning environment and i feel like my career has progressed more quickly by being able to learn from the best there has been significant room for promotion from within based on merit and the requirements for such are clearly defined i have not felt like politics played a part in the decisions which is always refreshing i have been able to prove my value through visible milestones and have been recognized accordingly it has also been possible to choose the direction and teams i wished to move forward with a high emphasis is placed on skill development and cross team training which helps with lateral and upward mobility as well finally i feel like what i do has a real and global impact i work with some of the largest companies in the world as well as amazon retail and ill occasionally hear about things i was a part of in the news i would not have had these kinds of opportunities at a smaller company theres just a vending machine in the break room snacks are not provided they also do not cater lunches i guess its fine but i do miss that from my previous employer they give out stock which is great but it vests over time and they claim its part of your total compensation which is the number they use for everything if the stock went up well your total compensation for this year is now higher so theyll use that as a reason to not give salary raises i don t love this because obviously the stock market is volatile and the times you can gain access to that stock are limited they claim the opposite would be true if the stock went down but that hasn t really happened in the last 3 4 years so its hard to say how that would work out its hard to complain too much about all the stock i have being too valuable though,highly engaged
awesome company amazing founders and senior management and ofcourse great perks you feel a sense of pride accomplishment and excitement walking into work every morning while company is great your particular team and work experience could be awful you could work really really long hours and pick up the slack for the rest of the team many managers hire accomplished and seasoned staff primarily to make up for their own lack of experience and knowledge so you may find yourself without proper guidance and in the position of a workhorse this company is best for people who join fresh out of college and grow within the org many others will be taking many steps back in their careers and work hard and long on a job that can be frustrating just to be a googler,highly engaged
i love my job i feel so good coming into work i am the happiest i ve ever been since i started working for apple lots of career opportunities great benefits awesome pay so i don t understand those who complain about it amazing team and environment rewarding work very busy which can get stressful no other cons but glass door makes me write at least 20 words for a review portion,highly engaged
leadership is amazing with satya heading up the company i loved my job it was challenging and extremely fun i was truly happy and proud to work for such an great company politics like everywhere if you are not part of the circle of friends you do not get that many opportunities or awards being a remote employee in the marketing team is difficult as you do not get a lot of opportunities compared with others located in seattle i was part of the recent reduction in force and it was a hard pill to swallow as i thought i did a tremendous job and i was regarded as a loyal and efficient employee,highly engaged
the atmosphere at apple is fantastic in terms of your colleagues and team they are selected well and a great sense of camaraderie if you work hard and succeed and your managers and colleagues like you you will do well generally most people are forward thinking and open minded the benefits and perks are fantastic for a retail job especially probably the best thing about working there always encouraging to do well and learn more whether you want to stay with the company or not gifts given often sometimes only small ones but nice incentives constantly informed about the company s values and ideas for the future great discount scheme especially if you love buying the products great holiday and extra days off every year opportunities for career experiences although sometimes difficult to be part of most higher managers very pleasant would say working part time definitely helps with work life balance everybody welcome the stores are always busy and you will feel a lot of pressure and often be rushed off of your feet and often shouted at by demanding customers depending what role you are in you can definitely be worked into the ground as there will never be enough staff to support the customers some of the roles can be monotonous and tiresome lots of managers and management roles which can mean if this is the area you want to succeed in it can be difficult took many years of working there to be recognised whereas some louder members of staff can be recognised just because they shout louder but aren t always as skilled not a good route to working at corporate sometimes hard to move up the chain can take years for some people,highly engaged

great environment to work in amazing people and managers the pay and benefits are great i enjoyed going into work every day and helping people loved the product knowledge i got at the end of the day it is just a busy retail job they try to make it seem as though it is more than retail but for the most part you are just selling and answering questions,highly engaged
you will work with a lot of fantastic people benefits are excellent and customers are for the most part great you will learn a lot have a lot of fun but probably never go very far apple retail is not a career except maybe for managers managers are unprofessional and not supportive the company talks about work life balance but at least in retail it is often just talk employees gr burned out quickly and leadership lacks direction pay is good for retail but this is not traditional retail and for many jobs salaries are quite low,highly engaged
this job started off as one of the coolest most interesting things to happen to me job wise i made so many good friends and connections through apple retail i will have those connections for life perks were great discounts were great location was great i was really pleased in how the management was more flexible then i imagined before i was hired on everything seemed great at the start but now you ll want to read the cons where do i begin most customers lack basic common sense with electronic gadgets then they have the gall to call you a greenhorn and scoff at you because of their ignorance highly distasteful attitudes from customers that didn t get their way i worked in a high end part of town and all the elites shopped i felt that everyone in the genius bar area had their head so far up the backside that any new hire was a complete newcomer and knew absolutely nothing about computers very disappointing to work with know it alls every day i will say that there was a nice hazing at first instead of the bad hazing i was treated overly nice for the first three months there s a ton of training that is involved when you re first hired on there s always a push to do it all within a really small amount of time it s usually always busy in any of the apple retail stores when it comes down to the wire the hustle you like no tomorrow management was somewhat of a disappointment i have to say that the management is under extreme pressure to do things a certain way so that is my grain of salt for this situation expect them to constantly remind you of this and that they seemed to be constantly overwhelmed and would forget about lunch breaks things of that nature i didn t like how some of the management would talk down to you how everything is so beautiful wonderful devine and enchanted how it s a privilege to work for apple apple has the privilege of hiring on some of the most amazing people i ve been around being a realist it is best to be cut and dry being talked down to constantly by people that are typically younger than yourself not very enjoyable it was difficult to advance in the company because of bad management situations set schedules for talks were always canceled and most of the folks that were a tutor mentor would get out of there as soon as they were done with work same for me,highly engaged
working at google you have really smart co workers in the beginning it struck me that people quickly understood my ideas something i wasn t used to from college another great advantage at google is that it is very engineering driven generally engineers are given enough of freedom to work on what they consider to be most important the role of product managers is to help engineers figure out what that is and to help in communications but ultimately engineers are making the decision being an engineer i very much enjoy this and i think it makes a lot of sense given that engineers understand the technologies involved best a lot of the interesting problems and challenges have already been solved in particular as a junior software engineer you ll work on not so exciting tasks also due to the fast growth of the company the impact an individual makes is not as big as it used to be,highly engaged
fun and challenging work with great customer service ethos a lot of freedom to develop into the best version of you incredible benefits package discounts career development info health development info and wonderful and varied co workers you get to work with some great equipment feel part of something bigger than yourself and best of all see how your work can impact the community around you in terms of the business side of things their model is unlike any other business team out there no cold calls no hard sells and mostly smooth sales processes which you manage from start to finish the likelihood of you bumping into a senior figure within the company hierarchy is incredible no matter what job role you start at and can put into perspective why the company is as successful as it is managers can be unrealistic in their expectations of a work life balance their understanding of work occurring on the front line and their capability to help you progress professionally in retail expect to work all holidays and book 3 4 weeks in advance for time off better to think of your job with working hour expectations like those of a nurse or police no matter what role you have customers can ask very difficult questions about the decisions made at the highest level you are their punching bag expect it even apple s computer systems go through hiccups the embarrassment in front of a customer is not fun especially if you re trying to meet their timeframe requirements unlike other big companies changes happen very very fast you might be kept in the dark about the reasoning and it might be hard to deal with but you ll just have to trust the decisions are being made for a reason think lack of stock for a few months then suddenly a new product or the lineup completely disappears in terms of the business side of things the rest of the store will ostracise you thinking you re like some kind of devil dealing salesperson maybe just subconsciously but you ll always have a battle convincing your colleagues just how important leads are to you cold or otherwise the lack of b2b acumen around you means you can feel like you fight the same uphill battles with little gains,highly engaged

the best thing about working at google is being surrounded by wicked smart highly motivated people things move at a very fast pace and the benefits are excellent the things that make google great are also what make it challenging it is a tough corporate culture where only the strong survive,highly engaged
google hires very smart people and allows them to participate in the culture this means your coworkers will likely be very interesting and fun and you ll probably enjoy the office environment immensely you ll learn a lot the hours are very flexible and the company takes the notion of work life balance as it applies to the workday very seriously though there s a dark reason for this and the perks are second to none compensation is also quite competitive as you rise through the ranks and the food i still dream about the food it s a great place to build a stable career if you love coding but aren t super entrepreneurial and don t make tons of contributions to open source projects see the cons for why these would be issues the workplace environment is often replicated but nobody else has matched it yet the cons are flipped versions of the pros google hires very smart people and then puts them in fairly mundane roles they used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating they seem to do much less of this as they ve grown if you re at all purpose driven you ll eventually become restless at work looking for something with more meaning than the project you re on you could potentially 20 something but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years more disturbingly there s a severe opportunity cost to your side projects their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in california they instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile and perhaps the desktop as well is competitive with them there s a committee that will examine ideas but it appears to be moribund google has grown tremendously and systematized to the point where it s a large machine needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running the culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn t been able to reconcile it with its growth and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at me too projects such as google i predict that this will hurt the company s outlook in the long term as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks as it becomes less entrepreneurial it becomes less able to diversify into new areas and thus becomes less resilient i would expect this to take 5 10 years to become apparent the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse which means that it may not be an issue for most people considering it now one other thing i ve found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal they re generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy food and facilities people are the exception as they do often take engineers feedback into account,highly engaged
when you venture into a job with amazon you are likely not going to be prepared for what you experience amazon is a place where you will have very challenging work for a very good cause customer experience i have a career of working in the customer service business and i ve learned more and achieved more in my time with amazon than with any other organization people are passionate about the work which does result in sometimes heated conversations but those conversations are all grounded on one thing what is the best experience for customers it is refreshing to go into discussions with this same grounding as it enables you to walk out of the room and know the debate was not personal towards an individual but focused on doing the right thing for our customers i also appreciate the focus on excellence in written communication i have learned even more about the power of the written word than i knew coming into the company by applying your focus to writing a document you enable a clarity of thought that isn t seen through power point writing in a narrative format forces you to think critically about your proposal or update and forces you to think about the questions that others will have on your document while it may be a painful adjustment in the beginning you will quickly realize the value and will never want to go back the last big pro to working at amazon is that you never know what s going to happen next in my time with the company i ve seen us grow from a retailer to disruptor in the reading industry to disruptor in the tablet industry to a disruptor in the creation of digital content to who knows what is next to disrupt it is very exciting to work for a company that is constantly evolving and becoming a bigger part of the digital ecosystem while also challenging conventional thoughts about any industry no company is perfect at all things and there are certainly things amazon can do better first is correcting the perception that there is no work life balance i have been in roles in amazon where there was very little balance and i ve been in roles where there is a good balance what i ve come to learn is it is generally on me to draw those lines and stick to them the company does need to do more to help employees achieve a proper balance rather relying on the the good intentions of the employee or their manager if you don t live work in seattle get ready to adjust your life to the seattle timezone at amazon the world revolves around seattle and in my opinion is the chief reason why work life balance is a struggle for those in the field there are not enough people in seattle that think about other timezones when setting up meetings and such a 10am check in on a saturday morning seattle time during the holidays is a far cry from a 7pm check in on saturday evening when you work on the other side of the globe and it s summer while you can certainly speak up about it you may be the minority that is impacted that way and without senior leaders thinking about this you will generally suck it up and do it to avoid being a complainer a peer once chastised me to another peer when i was working internationally on when i would stop bringing up the international locations in our discussions to which that peer responded probably when we start thinking about the international locations on our own if you have a role that requires extensive international travel realize that all of those trips no matter how long will be in coach i ve flown in coach for over 24 hours in the air not counting time in airports for several required work trips a year while you may get to travel to some really great places there is a cost to your health this is done to be frugal but is one of the areas where i believe we are just cheap and senior leaders are scared to challenge it after seeing how leaders in the past were treated after challenging the policy you can read about it in the everything store i am in no way advocating for first class trips across the board but if the company is requiring you to travel where you will spend more than 8 10 hours in the air the least they can do is spend money to ensure you are comfortable and will arrive ready to get to work rather most employees leave on these longer trips a day earlier than they otherwise would so there is time to recover once you arrive when i ve brought this up to vps the common response is referring to the example discussed in the everything store and that it is career suicide to challenge this policy at an executive level once you travel frequently you can use the miles you ve accumulated for business travel to get upgrades but you are subject to the airlines upgrade policies which are very restrictive for international flights and sometimes impossible coach tickets are bought at the cheapest fair possible unless you pay out of pocket to upgrade the coach ticket to a fare that is eligible for complimentary upgrades the compensation philosophy is focused on base pay and restricted stock units while this is a great retention tool and drives ownership in employees to help the stock price improve it is painful for employees to have such shifts in their pay year to year that is largely driven by sways in the stock market when it s good it s great but when the market corrects itself it makes for a painful compensation discussion with your employees in the following years there is little done to really educate people on the philosophy outside of standard training at annual review time that is not very effective at helping people understand the value,highly engaged
amazon truly cares for their employees spoils them even every feedback is implemented when it comes to the well being of employees great leadership team who are ever approachable and friendly without the hierarchical rule despotism people work culture here is amazing to work with majority of the employees are highly motivated so it gets easier to work network across departments while handling launching a big project that involves multiple teams the site where i work at is extremely young with average age of 23 approx and is always buzzing with a lot of energy with events celebrations happening every other day all the employees find it a lot of fun to come to work everyday all the team managers i have reported to worked with so far are fair and handle teams pretty decently being so successful comes with a price for an e commerce giant like amazon to be as good as we are globally working round the clock literally 24 7 shifts is key to meet the increasing demands of the customers and customer obsession is taken to another level as jeff b says it with 24 7 shifts it does take a toll on health in the long term the site where i work is expanding rapidly each year which means one has to be open to take on multiple roles within the area of expertise than the one that they were initially hired for this maybe particularly challenging for some who may not be too keen on widening their horizon,highly engaged
fun products to work on fellow team members are great to work with the content groups at microsoft may not be shipping code popping champagne at parties or hob knobbing with fancy upper level types but content publishers are down to earth creative smart and work earnestly to give microsoft customers helpful information they work super hard to save customers many content teams have great feedback systems where you will be able to see how effective your content is and many systems provide customer comments that can be extremely complimentary choose the group have informational interviews with the boss and team members if possible before applying for something if you feel cozy with the boss and other teammates have a formal interview if you sense a negative or stressed out spirit don t interview have an informational with another manager and keep moving til you find good people great working environment nice cafeterias pretty good health coverage although the paperwork and overhead required to manage reimbursement can be a little time consuming being in the content discipline can be challenging here because devs and pms are considered the most valuable so occasionally you have to wrestle information from someone who thinks you re not as smart as them tip just rollover you re probably smarter anyway and it s a waste of time proving yourself to them or sometimes you have to prove your worth to people which can be exhausting just keep your eye on the prize do what you do best and crank out the content there s also this there s your job content and then there s the extras the extras here are not really extras they re required for you to survive the extras are labelled differently depending on the manager or group projects stretch goals stretch projects visibility projects being visible v teams etc you ll be asked to do this so be ready gone are the days where you just work on content there s a new campaign called one microsoft that seems to lessen the competiveness and it s helped some people but others are stuck in the old don t step on my turf syndrome in my experience managers don t manage your day to day they manage the people above them and occasionally dip down to see what you are doing this can be really awesome at times because you have freedom but occasionally you do need direction and they may not feel knowledgeable enough with your work to help out usually you have to sort it out for yourself,highly engaged
flexible work hours good pay and reasonable benefits smart and passionate employees empower and ownership for work you do i really enjoyed my 7 years working at amazon it s a great company with a clear vision jeff bezos is an incredibly smart not for everyone it s a fast paced company which expects accountability for everything you do both successes and failures i loved it but not everyone thrives in that environment hard place to work high expectations and demanding leaders,highly engaged
i have been working at amazon full time more than 2 year ago i had an amazing time working with amazon many learning and growth opportunities if you are talented and interested you can move to any field in amazon internally best environment to work and the awesome and supportive colleagues who are always ready to support you work culture is at par with any other company no dress code like formal attire provides authority and responsibility for all the employees and great place to learn and grow one of the best pros is the package it provides as compared to other similar organizations and also amazon provide work from home facility which is also awesome 1 sudden changes in the process without thinking about the employee concerns 2 growing inside is a little problematic if you are not sure of which teams to move onto for building your career as it might be a boon or bane,highly engaged
i loved my experience with apple i started out at their corporate headquarters in austin and worked for three retail stores afterwards the coworkers have completely made the experience for me i have met so many passionate people and made many lasting friendships they pay well above minimum wage most likely the highest of any retail store there are goals but no commission so the pressure is not on you to force the customers into something they do not want managers treat employees very fairly and have shown great compassion when real life gets in the way of work life they have the best benefits package of any company i have ever worked for great discounts on products and employee stock purchase discounts too you have the opportunity to make lateral moves within the company to find our what role makes you happiest apple was a job not a career for me it didn t pay me more than i made in other more corporate settings but if happiness had a price this company was better to me than any other if you wanted to start at the entry level and move to management it would take many many years if at all if you want to be a retail store manager you would have to be a manager somewhere else first and be at the top of your game there is no set schedule for 90 of the employees it can be difficult to take vacations around the holidays if you cannot handle tons of crowds and talking to people all day long this would not be the job for you it can be mentally and socially exhausting at the end of the day entitled customers break their own gadgets and get mad at you for it that is one of the worst parts,highly engaged
everyone works together to achieve big and have fun while doing it the perks are unbelievable food massage gyms discounts etc but the best part is being surrounded by such amazing talent it s truly inspiring if you want to excel no one forces you to you have to put in long hours and go beyond expectations helping other team members out and participating in projects outside of your team it can get tough to balance work and play when you re working this hard but really who gets a job at google to be lazy,highly engaged
a lot of work to be done means you have flexibility on what to work and there s ample opportunities to do something awesome perks are amazing but they re made so you don t stress with the little details of life i work less hours in average than my previous top company job but achieve a lot more in that time no micro management overall obviously there are black sheep everywhere you do need to know how to prioritize and work by yourself without being pushed though mission and vision that matter to the world don t be evil eh right here we re truly connecting the world very few teams focus on revenue which is awesome excellent compensation do i need to say more travel to hq if you re a remote team it s not so often so i enjoy it personal thing though the other g giant has a few more extra perks that are nicer but you can live without them growing very fast hoping quality does not deteriorate but things can get messy,highly engaged
i absolutely loved my time at facebook i was lucky enough to work with talented passionate knowledgeable people who were super supportive and friendly you re positively encouraged to express your ideas and trusted to work autonomously the work is challenging and interesting and the social aspect is great too there s always something to get involved with should you want to they provide free breakfast lunch and dinner which is pretty amazing despite contracts running 11 months which sucks they actively stay in contact try and find way of getting great people to stay come back the hours are long but no longer than any other job i ve had in london and the rewards and job satisfaction are well worth it hard for me to find any cons but if pushed would say lack of headcount,highly engaged
awesome people hands down peers and colleagues some of the brightest people company policies on expenses perks family pets etc all outstanding salary isn t the best on the market google knows it can pay less than it has to because people want to work for it google has departments working on formulas meant to pay you as little as possible huge fight to get to the top everyone is in a race a culture of overachievers which means you have to sacrifice personal and social life to move up the ranks i ve seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing too much also middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you everything is in formulas and just doing a great job is not enough you need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted also the commute from the city sucks oh and the company s product strategy is a laughing stock google jumps on every shiny object it s one thing to reinvent an industry but to launch clones is just low google is shoved down everyone s throat google offers was a groupon clone and nobody cares about the user the company is totally evil decisions are made based on and not the user in mind don t be fooled,highly engaged
people are awesome they help you grow and a very open minded and supporting environment great perk i feel less politics in career track as long as you gain support and trust from team members people are too good and you feel peer pressure in terms of trying to survive from a company where many of the people enjoy and love what they do and are full of passion,highly engaged

i ve worked in the tech industry for over 10 years both in silicon valley and seattle i can honestly say amazon is the most innovative place i ve ever seen people here are the some of the smartest on the planet and they want to make big things happen people who do well here absolutely have passion for what they do and a relentless drive to do better they re not afraid of hard work and rolling up your sleeves to get the job done it s a scrappy fast paced environment and i love that we are not afraid to try something new every day the pace at which things happen is mind blowing at times and can be hard to keep up it s fun and exciting but you really have to know how to pace yourself or you can easily burn out this also isn t an environment where you ll feel pampered it s real and substance matters more than style the best idea no matter where it comes from is all that matters personal accountability is key and sometimes you feel like you re failing more than you re succeeding you have to have stamina and grit to get through some of the challenges when you re trying to do something that no one else has before,highly engaged
decent base salary excellent benefits package and awesome office facilities people who work there generally love it and i always found i was a good as my team which was normally great a competitive culture is created which does push people to excel bonuses change every year normally for the worse management has too many people who lack people management skills less training then there use to be a culture of vesters and resters normally 15 years in middle management with little ambition or desire to do well while they sit on their pile of unvested stock,highly engaged
great products exciting atmosphere diverse customers many wonderful people to work alongside and occasionally great people to work under overworked underpaid and under appreciated disparate employee expectations the social circles you travel in dictate what you can get away with plenty of nepotism and favoritism to go around crazy hours and scheduling apple s expectation is that apple always comes first in your life constantly being made to sign nondisclosure agreements literally every day for an entire week time clock which despite apple s amazing technology somehow manages to shave clocked hours on a regular basis worst ever aspect was being instructed to racially profile customers to ensure that products are getting into the hands of promoters and being instructed to refuse sales to customers who don t fit the bill yes really,highly engaged
i ve been working with microsoft for almost eight years now i ve met incredible smart passionate hardworking people the work is challenging but it also gives you a freedom to choose what role works best for you the benefits are excellent overall a the review system is always tough it s almost the case that you ll have to give your 110 to get a good to great review it s definitely one of the most competitive companies i ve ever seen though it s also rich in development support managers are trained and rewarded to treat employees well,highly engaged

there are some real opportunities for rapid growth at apple there really is that makes this job in my opinion the best retail experience you can have i came into apple without any retail experience and i m now confident enough with it that i really could take on any kind of retail sales experience if you enjoy staying busy being surrounded with questions coming from many different ways and being part of a company that has arguably the most in demand technology in the world apple is an amazing place to work with that said it s a tough place to leave because people end up getting so emotionally connected to the benefits of working for such a profitable growing and family oriented company i love every minute of it because apple products are always incredibly innovative and well designed there is an incredible demand for them the retail stores are essentially the face of apple therefore they are thee only places many people know to get their apple products what this means with a job at apple is that you will always be busy you will always be pressed to work more hours and you will find it very difficult to get time off for instance i once requested the week before thanksgiving off 5 months in advance and wasn t approved for it it s tough but logical apple has tried to accomodate by hiring more staff but unfortunately apple cannot seem to hire enough people as the demand just continues to grows at an unbelievable pace,highly engaged
good benefits most coworkers are amazing interesting work experience easy hiring process favoritism there are so many hard working employees who really try to love their job and move up and be loyal to the company but none of that is recognized by management they pick their favorites who get the easy jobs that are not rated priority training and groomed to move up when people who actually deserve to move up get passed over employees are expected to move at a ridiculously high pace doing the same repetetive task for 10 12 hours a day in the heat on concrete floors without getting switched while the favorites get to pick what job they want to do getting written up is such a normal part of day to day that whenever someone new is upset about getting written up the general response is don t worry it happens to everyone during peak in some functions it is impossible to make rate which will earn employees a write up every week and 3 will get an associate fired managers have the ability to overlook the write up and prevent associates from getting more but will only do so if the employee is one of the favorites they say safety is their number one priority but safety rules go out the window and managers will overlook safety violations to make rate as long as the safety team is not watching because of this almost all associates dislike their jobs and cannot wait to leave also almost no member managment has actually been an associate because they are hired young and straight out of college which would be great but they don t understand nor do they care about employees barriers management moves around so much thay in the 2 years that i was there my direct manager changed 6 times and my ops managers changed 4 so essentially it is impossible to build any type of professional rapport with management hr is only there to make the employees feel like there is a support system when things are happening that are wrong but they don t really do anything unless they feel that the company is at immediate risk of a lawsuit if no action is taken there had been managers that had hundreds of complaints against them by multiple people for unfair treatment sexual harrasment along with various other issues and nothing was ever done until there was concret proof that they were a liability to the company company values are just words nothing more management loves to hear them in interviews but they are never actually utilized all in all i believe that the company has awesome potential and it does great things for the community but unless multiple changes are made i would never recommend it to anyone,highly engaged
extremely smart people wonderful and exciting products great management and growth opportunities proud of the work we do here amazing compensation and benefits employee happiness and retention is top priority it is a big company so things can be slow due to the secretive nature of apple we can discuss the things we are working on to friends spouses or on social media can t contribute to the open source community or speak at conferences,highly engaged
fun environment fantastic support from coworkers extremely passionate people felt i mattered to both my coworkers and my managers lots of customer interaction which can be a pro or a con you just have to have the right mindset and find your stride overall though a great place to work and i made many friends whom i still keep in touch with even after 2 years out of the job,highly engaged
microsoft is concerned that employees enjoy a fun working environment and they create an excellent working atmosphere often times there are great incentives and perks that are added to your paycheck as and added bonus depending on the demographics of the work location there is often insecurities about competition and when an employee daily goal was not met if you re a contracted employee you do not get the inside scoop,highly engaged
great culture management genuinely cares about staff happiness career pathing growth and personal development as the company scales you get a sense that everyone wants to retain the hack culture the ability to move fast and to avoid bureaucratic systems while offering opportunities to everyone and avoid any hand picking and keeping company politics to a minimum the working environment is collaborative open and focused on impact people some of the smartest people i have ever had a chance to deal with hard working fun collaborative creative and driven they are not all made from the same mold and diversity is important in dublin i love the multicultural environment it is respectful of everyone s culture and creates a great vibe around the office perks alright so the initial salary is not the highest compared to other companies i have worked for however the 6 monthly bonuses performance based stock salary adjustment every year free healthy delicious food all day really add up i have had higher base salaries in previous jobs but going to work every day without fearing what the day brings and lower stress levels are just priceless also put in the irish dublin context very very grim unemployment figures it is a solid job with career prospects what we do putting aside the people the cool office and many perks i really love what i do we support hundreds of million users across emea latin america and working on such a scale is inspiring i feel immensely proud of what we are achieving every day work life balance can be at times poor no one is really putting a gun to my head to work this hard but i feel a sense of duty to our teams and our users as the company scale i have seen some office politics creeping up here and there i also hate the sense of entitlement that pops up every now and then,highly engaged
amazing environment with a strong focus on getting things done vs politics or process when bad things happen the focus is always on finding a fix rather than finding the blame organized chaos working with some of the smartest and most knowledgeable people i ve ever met they don t just throw money away but they re willing to spend to solve problems or improve things when it s needed the benefits like free food are excellent and in general they treat their employees like human adults instead of children or replaceable cogs or numbers the biggest downside is the organized chaos although that s also a plus at times it can be a bit too chaotic though even that s improving,highly engaged
